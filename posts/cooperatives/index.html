<p>Why do capital-managed firms predominate over worker cooperatives? Perhaps it’s because worker cooperatives have less incentive to expand.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The <a href="#arg-map" id="predominate">predominance of capital-managed firms (CMF) over worker cooperatives (WC)</a> remains an open question in economics. Early explanations relied on a hypothesized comparative inefficiency of cooperatives. Subsequent empirical study has shown that <a href="#arg-map" id="efficient">cooperatives are at least as efficient as capital-managed firms</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="doucouliagos95">(Doucouliagos 1995)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="estrin87">(Estrin, Jones, and Svejnar 1987)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="craig95">(Craig et al. 1995)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="levine90">(Levine 1990)</span>.</p>
<p>A profusion of hypotheses has since arisen. <span class="citation" data-cites="dow99">(Dow and Putterman 1999)</span> offers a good summary (though the term must be used loosely for a 126-page paper). One that I have not seen presented is: <a href="#arg-map" id="hypothesis">capital-managed firms predominate because capitalists have a greater incentive to expand than worker-owners in worker cooperatives</a>. Roughly, for each market segment a capitalist expands into, their income increases by capital’s share of the new segment’s profit. For each market segment a cooperative expands into, the expanders receive no direct remuneration (supposing that the new market segment is also a cooperative). Any new profit goes to worker-owners in the new segment.</p>

<h3 id="cellular-automaton">Cellular automaton</h3>
<p>We can make this hypothesis more tangible by representing it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton</a>. <span class="noted"><a href="#arg-map" id="automaton-link">In this automaton</a></span><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, <a href="#arg-map" id="segment">each cell represents a market segment requiring a fixed quantity of labor and capital</a>. Adjacent cells represent similar market segments.</p>
<div id="automaton"></div>

<h4 id="initial-conditions">Initial conditions</h4>
<p>In the beginning, the market is filled with <a href="#arg-map" id="empty">empty market segments which have a random cost</a> (represented in the automaton by the opacity of the <span class="empty">red cell interiors</span>) for a firm to expand into.</p>
<h4 id="step">Step</h4>
<h5 id="occupied-market-segments">Occupied market segments</h5>
<p>In each step, an existing firm may go bankrupt (or exit the market segment in some other way) with fixed probability <span class="math">\(B = 0.1\)</span>. If a firm goes bankrupt, its market segment becomes empty once again.</p>
<p>If it does not go bankrupt, <a href="#arg-map" id="accum">the profits generated during that step are distributed</a>. For worker cooperatives, all profits accrue to the worker-owners within the cooperative. For capital-managed segments, labor’s share of income (estimated at 70% <span class="citation" data-cites="karabarbounis13">(Karabarbounis and Neiman 2013)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="gomme04">(Gomme and Rupert 2004)</span>) accrues to the segment’s workers and capital’s share of income accrues to the capitalists of the segment’s firm.</p>
<p>The accumulated income of workers in a capital-managed segment is represented in the automaton by opacity of the <span class="capital">purple cell interior</span>. The accumulated income of the capitalists (of a given firm) is represented by the opacity of the <span class="capital">purple cell border</span> enclosing all segments owned by the firm. The accumulated income of worker-owners in a worker cooperative is represented in the automaton by the opacity of the <span class="labor">green cell interior</span>. Worker cooperatives sharing an ancestor (e.g. cooperative B and C were both founded by cooperative A) are enclosed by a single border.</p>
<h5 id="empty-market-segments">Empty market segments</h5>
<p>In each step, an empty market segment may be occupied by <a href="#arg-map" id="firm">a newly formed firm</a> with chance <span class="math">\(N = 0.001\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also, in each step, <a href="#arg-map" id="expand">an empty market segment may be subject to expansion</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood">adjacent firms</a>. Each adjacent firm has a 20% chance of attempting expansion (representing market conditions, firm conditions, &amp;c.). The cost of expansion into the market segment must be less than the accumulated income of the expander and less than the projected value of the segment. In the event of multiple firms competing to expand into a single segment, the firm with the greatest valuation for the segment succeeds.</p>
<p>Valuations are determined thus:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Capital-managed firm</dt>
<dd>The total value a capital-management firm can expect to extract from a segment takes the form <span class="math">\(KP + KP(1 - B)(1 - D) + KP(1 - B)^2(1 - D)^2 + \ldots\)</span> where <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is capital’s share of income, <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is the per-step profit, <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is the bankruptcy rate, and <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is the firm’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value">discount rate</a> (ranging uniformly from <span class="math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(0.2\)</span>). Using the formula for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula">geometric series</a>, we can write this as <span class="math">\(\frac{KP}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)}\)</span>.
</dd>
<dt>Worker cooperative</dt>
<dd>Similarly, the total value a worker cooperative can expect to extract from a segment takes the form <span class="math">\(\frac{AS}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)}\)</span>. <span class="math">\(S = GP -  LP\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is the productivity advantage of worker cooperatives (set to 1.1 in the automaton) and <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is labor’s share of income, represents the comparative benefit for worker-owners in a worker cooperative over being laborers in a capital-managed firm. <a href="#arg-map" id="altruism"> <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (<q>altruism</q>) represents the extent to which the expanding worker cooperative cares about these potential gains.</a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A quick consequence of this model is that worker cooperatives and capital-managed firms will value expansions equally (assuming equal discount and bankruptcy rates) when</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align}
\frac{AS}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)} &amp;= \frac{KP}{1 - (1 - B)(1 - D)} \\
AS &amp;= KP \\
A(GP - LP) &amp;= KP \\
AP(G - L) &amp;= KP \\
A(G - L) &amp;= K \\
A &amp;= \frac{K}{G - L} \\
A &amp;= \frac{K}{K - 1 + G} \\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
