# Replications

Theoretical models suggest that many published research findings are false [@ioannidis05b]. Empirical evidence in a variety of fields tends to support the claim [@ioannidis05b] [@dewald86].

Replication should help.

However, replications are rare (a study of psychology journals concluded that approximately 1% of all articles were replications) [@makel12]. Even when higher powered replications contradict original studies, the refuted studies remain frequently and favorably cited indefinitely [@tatsioni07].

# Bibliometrics

There are a variety of citation-based [bibliometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliometrics). The current dominant metric is [impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor). It is highly influential, factoring into decisions on promotion, hiring, tenure, grants and departmental funding [@plos06] [@agrawal05] [@moustafa14]. Editors preferentially publish review articles and push authors to [self-cite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercive_citation) in pursuit of increase impact factor [@plos06] [@agrawal05] [@wilhite12]. Consequently, academics take impact factor into account throughout the planning, execution and reporting of a study [@plos06].

# Reasons for Underprovision

One reason for the underprovision of replications is editorial bias against them [@neuliep90]. This bias is plausibly motivated by the pursuit of an increased impact factor, since replications are undercited [@brembs13]. Academics that do conduct replications are shunted to low impact journals [@brembs13]. In vulgar terms, the decreased citation rate for replications has concrete financial costs for academics [@hamermesh82].

# Tweak

All of this suggests that improving the relative citation rate of replications, especially those that refute earlier studies, would be salubrious. Valenced citations plausibly achieve this goal.  

Feasibility


Thomson Scientific, the sole arbiter of the impact factor game, is part of The Thomson Corporation, a for-profit organization that is responsible primarily to its shareholders. It has no obligation to be accountable to any of the stakeholders who care most about the impact factor—the authors and readers of scientific research.

[@plos06]

no-one cares about the large majority of scientific results—whether they are right or wrong makes no difference to anyone. A reasonable guess, based on some old surveys, is that about 50 percent of scientific papers are not read by anyone except the author , referees, and editor, while studies of the citation indice s suggest that about 90 percent of published papers are never cited.
