Like the optimizer's curse, if we try to make policy decisions based on exemplars, we may systematically mislead ourselves by picking the luckiest polities rather than the wisest. If we try to replicate the policies of these lucky polities, regression toward the mean suggests we'll meet with disappointment. This theory might apply to Singapore.
