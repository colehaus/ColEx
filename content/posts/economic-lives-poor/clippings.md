# The Living Arrangements of the Poor

The typical extremely poor family tends to be large, at least by the standards of
today’s high-income countries. The number of family members varies between
about six and twelve, with a median value (across the different countries) of
between seven and eight, compared to 2.5 in the 2000 U.S. census, for example.

The number of adults
(over age 18) ranges from about 2.5 to about five, with a median of about three,
which suggests a family structure where it is common for adults to live with parents,
siblings, uncles, cousins, and so on. 

The ratio of the
number older people (over age 51) to the number of people of “prime-age”
(21–50) tends to be between 0.2 and 0.3 in both the rural and the urban sample.
The corresponding number in the United States is approximately 0.6.

# How the poor spend their money

## Food and other consumption purchases

Among our 13 countries, food typically represents from 56 to 78 percent of consumption among rural households, and 56 to 74 percent in urban areas.

The extremely poor in rural areas spent 4.1 percent of their budget on tobacco and
alcohol in Papua New Guinea; 5.0 percent in Udaipur, India; 6.0 percent in
Indonesia; and 8.1 percent in Mexico. However, in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
Peru, no more than 1 percent of the budget gets spent on these goods (possibly
because the poor in these countries prefer other intoxicants).

In Udaipur, [... t]he median household spent 10 percent of its annual budget on festivals.

On the other hand, the under-$1-per-day households spend very little on forms
of entertainment common in high-income countries such as movies, theater, or
video shows. In all 13 countries in our sample, in the month preceding the survey
the average extremely poor household spent less than 1 percent on any of these
forms of entertainment. The comparable number for the United States is 5 percent.

## The ownership of assets

In all countries, the share of rural
households owning a television is substantially larger for those who live on less than
$2 a day than those living on less than $1 a day. For example, the share owning a
television increases from 14 percent for those living on $1 a day to 45 percent for
those living on less than $2 a dollar a day in Cote d’Ivoire; from 7 to 17 percent in
South Africa; and from 10 to 21 percent in Peru. 

Only 4 percent of those living under $1 a day own land in Mexico, 1.4 percent in South Africa,
30 percent in Pakistan, 37 percent in Guatemala, 50 percent in Nicaragua and
Indonesia, 63 percent in Cote d’Ivoire, 65 percent in Peru, and 85 percent in
Panama. In the Udaipur sample, 99 percent of the households below $1 a day own
some land in addition to the land on which their house is built, although much of
it is dry scrubland that cannot be cultivated for most of the year. However, when the
extremely poor do own land, the plots tend to be quite small. The median
landholding among the poor who own land is one hectare or less in Udaipur,
Indonesia, Guatemala, and Timor; between one and two hectares in Peru, Tanzania, Pakistan; and between two and three hectares in Nicaragua, Cote d’Ivoire, and
Panama.

In Udaipur, where we have detailed asset data, most
extremely poor households have a bed or a cot, but only about 10 percent have a
chair or a stool and 5 percent have a table. [...] No one has a phone.

## The pursuit of health and well-being

Should we worry about the fact that the poor are buying less food than they
could? According to Deaton and Subramanian (1996), the poorest people—the
ones in the bottom decile in terms of per capita expenditure— consume on average
slightly less than 1400 calories a day. This level is about half of what the Indian
government recommends for a man with moderate activity, or a woman with heavy
physical activity

Among the extremely poor in Udaipur, only 57 percent report that the
members of their household had enough to eat throughout the year. Among the
poor adults in Udaipur, the average “body mass index” (that is, weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the height in meters) is 17.8. Sixty-five percent of adult
men and 40 percent of adult women have a body mass index below 18.5, the
standard cutoff for being underweight (WHO expert consultation, 2004). Moreover, 55 percent of the poor adults in Udaipur are anemic, which means they have
an insufficient number of red blood cells. The poor are frequently sick or weak.

Over the last year, in 45 percent of the extremely poor households in Udiapur (and
35 percent of those living under $2 a day) adults had to cut the size of their meal
at some point during the year and in 12 percent of them, children had to cut the
size of their meals. In the extremely poor households under $1 per day, 37 percent
report that, at some point in the past year, the adults in the household went without
a meal for an entire day. Cutting meals is also strongly correlated with unhappiness.

In
Udaipur, 72 percent report at least one symptom of disease and 46 percent report
an illness which has left them bedridden or necessitated a visit to the doctor over
the last month. Forty-three percent of the adults and 34 percent of the adults aged
under 50 report difficulty carrying out at least one of their “activities of daily living,”
such as working in the field, walking, or drawing water from a well.

Among the
rural poor living under $1 a day in Peru, South Africa, East Timor, Panama, and
Tanzania, between 11 and 15 percent of households report having a member either
being bedridden for at least a day or requiring a doctor. The number is between
21 and 28 percent in Pakistan, Indonesia, and Cote d’Ivoire, and between 35 and
46 percent in Nicaragua, Udaipur, and Mexico.

While the poor certainly feel poor, their levels of
self-reported happiness or self-reported health levels are not particularly low (Banerjee, Duflo, and Deaton, 2004). On the other hand, the poor do report being
under a great deal of stress, both financial and psychological. In Udaipur, about
12 percent say that there has been a period of one month or more in the last year
in which they were so “worried, tense, or anxious” that it interfered with normal
activities like sleeping, working, and eating.

## Investment in education

The expenditure on
education generally hovers around 2 percent of household budgets: higher in
Pakistan (3 percent), Indonesia (6 percent), and Cote d’Ivoire (6 percent), but
much lower in Guatemala (0.1 percent), and South Africa (0.8 percent).

This low level
of expenditure on education is not because the children are out of school. In 12 of
the 13 countries in our sample, with the exception of Cote d’Ivoire, at least
50 percent of both boys and girls aged 7 to 12 in extremely poor households are in
school. In about half the countries, the proportion enrolled is greater than 75 percent among girls, and more than 80 percent among boys.

# How the poor earn their money

All over the world, a substantial fraction of the poor act as entrepreneurs in the
sense of raising capital, carrying out investment, and being the full residual claimants for the resulting earnings. In Peru, 69 percent of the households who live
under $2 a day in urban areas operate a nonagricultural business. In Indonesia,
Pakistan, and Nicaragua, the numbers are between 47 and 52 percent. A large
fraction of the rural poor operate a farm: 25 to 98 percent of the households who
earn less than a dollar a day report being self-employed in agriculture, except in
Mexico and South Africa where self-employment in agriculture is very rare.4
Moreover, many of the rural poor—from 7 percent in Udaipur up to 36 percent in
Panama—also operate a nonagricultural business.

Many poor households have multiple occupations. Like the dosa women of
Guntur, 21 percent of the households living under $2 a day in Hyderabad who have
a business actually have more than one, while another 13 percent have both a
business and a laborer’s job. This multiplicity of occupations in urban areas is
found in many other countries as well, though not everywhere. Among those
earning less than $2 a day, 47 percent of the urban households in Cote d’Ivoire and
Indonesia get their income from more than one source; 36 percent in Pakistan;
20.5 percent in Peru; and 24 percent in Mexico. However, in urban South Africa
and Panama, almost no one has more than one occupation and only 9 percent do
so in Nicaragua and Timor Leste.

The most common occupation for the poor in Udaipur is working as a daily
laborer: 98 percent of households living under $1 per day in rural areas report
doing this, and 74 percent claim it is their main source of earnings.

Strikingly, almost 10 percent of the time of the average household is spent on
gathering fuel, either for use at home or for sale. The median family in this survey
has three working members and seven occupations.

Overall, the fraction of the rural extremely poor
households who report that they conduct more than one type of activity to earn a
living is 50 percent in Indonesia, 72 percent in Cote d’Ivoire, 84 percent in
Guatemala, and 94 percent in Udaipur. It is smaller, but not negligible— between
10 and 20 percent—in Nicaragua, Panama, Timor Leste, and Mexico. Once again,
an exception to this general pattern is South Africa, where less than 1 percent of
the rural poor or extremely poor report multiple occupations.

## Temporary migration to work

in the Udaipur
survey, which had questions about this activity, 60 percent of the poorest households report that someone from their family had lived outside for a part of the year
to obtain work. For 58 percent of the families, the head of the household had
migrated. The migrants typically complete multiple trips in a year. However, people
do not leave for very long. The median length of a completed migration is one
month, and only 10 percent of migration episodes exceed three months. Nor do
most of the migrants travel very far: 28 percent stay in the district of Udaipur and
only 42 percent leave the state of Rajasthan.

Permanent migration for work reasons is rare, although many women move
when they marry. Even if we look at households currently living in urban areas,
where the inflow of immigrants is presumably higher than in rural areas, the share
of extremely poor households who had one member that was born elsewhere and
had migrated for work reasons was just 4 percent in Pakistan, 6 percent in Cote
d’Ivoire, 6 percent in Nicaragua, and almost 10 percent in Peru. The 1991 Census
of India reports that only 14.7 percent of the male population lives somewhere
other than where they were born. Indonesia is the only country in our data where
the proportion is higher: 41 percent of the urban households came from elsewhere.
Indonesia is also the only country in this sample where migration was explicitly
subsidized.

## The problem of scale

The scale of nonagricultural businesses run by the poor also tends to be small.
In the 13 countries in our sample, the median business operated by people living
under $2 dollars a day either in a rural or an urban location has no paid staff, and
the average number of paid employees range between 0.14 in rural Nicaragua to
0.53 in urban Panama. Businesses are operated on average by 1.38 (in Peru) to 2.59
(in Cote d’Ivoire) people—most of them being family members. Most of these
businesses have very few assets as well. In Hyderabad, only 20 percent of the
businesses operate out of a separate room. In Pakistan, about 40 percent of the
businesses of those living under $1 or $2 dollar a day have a vehicle, but only
4 percent have a motorized vehicle and none have any machinery. In other
countries, even nonmotorized vehicles are rare.

# Markets and the economic environment of the poor

## The market for credit and the poor

The data from our 13 countries suggests that the fraction of rural, extremely
poor households having an outstanding debt varies between countries, from 11 percent in rural East Timor to 93 percent in Pakistan. But across the surveys, very few
of the poor households get loans from a formal lending source.

Credit from informal sources tends to be expensive. In the Udaipur survey,
where we have data on interest rates not available in other surveys, those living on
less than $1 a day pay on average 3.84 percent per month for the credit they receive
from informal sources. Those who consume between $1 and $2 dollar a day per
capita pay a little less: 3.13 percent per month.

These high interest rates seem not to occur directly because of high rates of
default, but rather as a result of the high costs of contract enforcement. While delay
in repayment of informal loans is frequent, default is actually rare (Banerjee and
Duflo, 2005).

## The market for savings and the poor

Few poor households have savings accounts. Except in Cote d’Ivoire, where
79 percent of the extremely poor households under $1 a day have a savings
account, the fraction is below 14 percent in the other countries in our data. In
Panama and Peru, less than 1 percent of poor households have a savings account.

Indeed, one reason why many of the poor respond so well to microcredit is not
necessarily because it offers them credit, but because once you take a loan and buy
something with it, you have a disciplined way to save—namely, by paying down the
loan.

## The market for insurance and the poor

 In the six of our seven countries where such
data is available, less than 6 percent of the extremely poor are covered by health
insurance of any kind. The exception is Mexico, where about half of the extremely
poor have coverage.

In principle, social networks can provide informal insurance.

## The market for land and the poor

For historical reasons, land is the one asset the poor tend to own. But land
records in developing countries are often incomplete and many people do not have
titles to their land. As many including most famously Hernando De Soto (2003)
have emphasized, an unclear title makes it harder to sell the land or mortgage it.

Finally, a long tradition of research in agricultural economics argues that the
poor lack incentives to make the best use of the land they are cultivating because
they are agents rather than owners (Shaban, 1987). Banerjee, Gertler, and Ghatak
(2002) found that a reform of tenancy that forced landlords to raise the share of
output going to the sharecroppers and also gave them a secure right to the land
raised productivity by about 50 percent.

# Infrastructure and the economic environment for the poor

The availability of physical infrastructure to the poor like electricity, tap water,
and even basic sanitation (like access to a latrine) varies enormously across countries. In our sample of 13 countries, the number of rural poor households with
access to tap water varies from none in Udaipur to 36 percent in Guatemala. The
availability of electricity varies from 1.3 percent in Tanzania to 99 percent in
Mexico. The availability of a latrine varies from none in Udaipur to 100 percent in
Nicaragua. Different kinds of infrastructure do not always appear together. In
Indonesia, 97 percent of rural, extremely poor households have electricity but only
6 percent have tap water.

Most low-income countries have made some attempt to ensure that poor
households have access to primary schools and basic health centers. For example,
most Indian villages now have a school within a kilometer, and a health subcenter
exists for every 10,000 people. However, the quality of the facilities that serve the
poor tends to be low, even when they are available, and it is not clear how much
they actually deliver. [...] They found that the average absence rate among teachers is 19 percent and the average absence rate among health workers is 35 percent.

In fact, an expert panel found that the treatments suggested by the average
provider in their sample are slightly more likely to do harm rather than good, due
to a combination of misdiagnosis and overmedication.

Among the rural, extremely poor, the lowest infant mortality that we observe
is 3.4 percent in Indonesia. At the high end, infant mortality among the extremely
poor is 8.7 percent in South Africa and Tanzania, 10 percent in Udaipur, and
16.7 percent in Pakistan. The rates are lower, but not much lower, in urban areas.

 In India, despite the fact that 93.4 percent of children ages 6 –14 are
enrolled in schools (75 percent of them in government schools), a recent nationwide survey found that 34.9 percent of the children age 7 to 14 cannot read a simple
paragraph at second-grade level (Pratham, 2006). Moreover, 41.1 percent cannot
do subtraction, and 65.5 percent cannot do division. Even among children in
grades six to eight in government schools, 22 percent cannot read a second-grade
text.
