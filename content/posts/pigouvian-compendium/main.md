We've already established that I'm a fan of [Pigouvian taxes](/posts/why-opposition-pigovian-taxes/) and correcting externalities. The harms I visit on my neighbor should be the result of malice aforethought; we should have to look each other in the eye rather than shrug in world-weary acknowledgment of systemic perversities. Because of that interest, I wanted a sense of the total magnitude of Pigouvian taxation possible. Are American GDP numbers the result of accounting fraud that would put [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron) to shame? How much would American production numbers decrease if we accounted for externalities? If the federal government shared my zeal for technocratic delights, how much of the federal budget could be funded by Pigouvian taxes? How much would an individual's annual expenses increase if they'd internalized all their externalities and been absolved of their sins?

To answer those questions, I reviewed the academic literature and found every proposed Pigouvian tax I could. I did not include:

General sin taxes
:   Public health practitioners and others sometimes talk about taxing certain goods on the grounds that they correct for irrationality. ~~Plebes~~ People don't know about the long-term harmful effects of sugary drinks or lack self-control, for example. Or cigarette taxes should be increased to stop people from ~~enjoying themselves~~ killing themselves prematurely. While there are reasonable arguments (despite the snark above) in support of such taxes, these aren't the same as Pigouvian taxes. Pigouvian taxes correct for externalities and arise even with rAtIoNaL actors due to inherent failures of markets; these other taxes try to [nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)) toward actions that don't create externalities and wouldn't occur with rAtIoNaL actors.

Uncalibrated taxes
:   There are many jurisdictions that have taxes on externality-producing consumption---think cigarette taxes or alcohol taxes. However, these are just as likely to be the result of smoky backroom deals as of analysis grounded in an estimation of the externalities imposed by consumption. Thus, I excluded them and only looked for taxes (real or proposed) where numbers were intended to precisely 'internalize' externalities.

The results of this review are presented in the table below. The externalities associated with emitting carbon and driving are the largest by far. If we sum up all the known externalities listed in the table, we find that they come to $679 billion per year in the US. This is around 3.5% of US GDP and around 15% of [US federal spending](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-spending-3305763). The per capita cost of these externalities is around over $2150 per year. (The sum of externalities is described on annual basis and so excludes quantities which are stocks rather than annual flows. In particular, obesity and <abbr title="Small and medium enterprises">SME</abbr> debt are current totals rather than annual changes.)

# Driving

<figure>

<figcaption>A direct regulation alternative---mandatory goblin masks for all motor vehicles---to Pigouvian taxes could also help us understand the evils of driving.</figcaption>
</figure>

Everyone knows they're killing the planet one mile at a time when they drive. What's perhaps less obvious is that this is the least terrible thing about driving. The table below shows estimates of [the many external costs of driving]{.noted}[^overlap]. While driving's contribution to global warm costs 8.5 cents per gallon, the external costs of collisions clock in at 73 cents per gallon. The proper Pigouvian tax that would internalize all the externalities is estimated at $2.15 per gallon. This is substantially larger than the current fuel tax in the US which [averages 48 cents per gallon](https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/consumer-information/motor-fuel-taxes) and is, interestingly, substantially lower than the current fuel tax in [many European countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_tax).

Data from [@parry2007] and updated to [2018 dollars](http://www.in2013dollars.com/2007-dollars-in-2018?amount=1).
The original source assumes an on-road fuel economy of 20 miles per gallon for the purpose of converting between cents/gal and cents/mile. That seems somewhat dubious to me, but we'll go with it.

</figure>

Brief explanation of the less obvious externalities:

Congestion
:   When I pile into a traffic jam, everyone behind me is slowed down yet more.
Accidents
:   "[W]hen I drive, I make it more likely that you will be in an accident. That is an external cost, which from an economic standpoint is equivalent to pollution. The numbers here are staggering. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are more than 30 million traffic accidents a year. It estimates that the annual dollar cost of accidents, including property damage and personal injury, amounts to more than $400 billion a year." [@parry2007]

Okay, I lied when I said $2.15 per gallon "would internalize all the externalities". There are more externalities not in that table (omitted because their harms don't track fuel and mileage very well) because driving is a slow-motion apocalypse:

- Noise
- Highway maintenance costs
- Urban sprawl
- Parking subsidies
- Other environmental externalities

# Carbon

[William Nordhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nordhaus) was one of this year's [fake Nobel Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences) winners for his work on climate change. In [@nordhaus2007review], he suggests an initial carbon tax of [$50](http://www.in2013dollars.com/2005-dollars-in-2018?amount=38.5) per tonne of carbon which would increase by 2-3% a year in real terms until 2050 and steeper increases after that.

Such a carbon tax is, of course, intended to correct for the external harms of global warming.

But Nordhaus isn't the only person working to produce such [inconvenient truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth). There's a whole slew of estimates of the social cost of carbon. Toward the other end of the spectrum is [@stern2007economics] which estimates a social cost of carbon around [$340](http://www.in2013dollars.com/2007-dollars-in-2018?amount=280) per tonne. Because global warming plays out over decades and centuries, [the [pure rate of time preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference)]{.noted}[^time-preference] is one of the key determinants of the final number.

# Obesity

America has, variously, a [crisis](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/rising-obesity-united-states-public-health-crisis), an epidemic [@wang2007obesity], and an [apocalypse](https://www.amazon.com/Obesity-Apocalypse-Conspiracy/dp/1941188117) of obesity. Regardless of the descriptor, [@finkelstein2009annual] finds that the obese spend almost $1,500 more per year on medical services and that [Medicare and Medicaid account for at least half of this increased spending]{.noted}[^obesity]. "We estimate that a 1-unit increase in BMI for every adult in the United States would increase annual public medical expenditures (i.e., direct medical costs) by $38.7 billion; an average marginal cost of $175 per year per unit of BMI for each adult in the United States." [@parks2012marginal]

This is probably the right moment to bring up ([again](/posts/why-opposition-pigovian-taxes/#non-uniform-marginal-cost)) that Pigouvian taxes are not a good response to all externalities [@fleischer2015curb]. In particular, a one point increases in BMI is very harmful to the health of some while it's healthful for others. Thus, a tax which penalizes all weight gain equally could be called a Procrustean Pigouvian tax. It's also worth pointing out that the optimal weight from a public health perspective isn't settled [@afzal2016change].

# Alcohol

Coming next in our countdown is a classic sin tax---alcohol. There's yet more double-counting between this and driving because the biggest alcohol-related externality is drunk driving. With a 5% discount rate, the cost breakdown is as follows:

(One very dubious part of [@manning1989] is that it counts harms to family members as internal rather than external.)

Because "nearly all external costs are caused by 10% of the drinking population who consume one-third to one-half of all alcohol sold" [@cnossen2007] a targeted tax on excess drinking as [@manning1989] calculates would be the first best option. Alas, it's far from obvious how this targeting would be implemented. We adjust the tax to look at total alcohol consumption then. [@manning1989] reports that 40% of alcohol consumption is in excess of two drinks per day (their definition of 'excess drinking'). Multiplying "Total net costs" by 0.4 gets us the final cost of $1.10 per ounce ($37 per liter) which appears in the top table. ([@harwood2000updating] gives a broadly similar estimate of $62 per liter.)

<!-- The widely cited study by Leung and Phelps (1993) reviewed the results of studies estimating the price elasticity of alcohol demand. Although the studies show considerable variation, the broad pattern of results would be consistent with elasticities of -0.3 for beer, -1.0 for wine, and -1.5 for spirits. -->

<!-- Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998) find that the long-run elasticity in a model with addiction is some 50 per cent higher than the short-run elasticity -->

<!-- One of the most widely cited studies, by Leung and Phelps (1993), concludes that the price elasticities of alcohol demand are −0.3 for beer, −1.0 for wine and −1.5 for spirits. Clements et al. (1997) report price elasticities for seven countries (including three EU member states, i.e. Finland, Sweden and the UK), covering the period from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s. They find elasticities of −0.35 for beer, −0.68 for wine and −0.98 for spirits, which are broadly in line with those found for the US. -->

<!-- Intuitively, moderate drinkers should be more price responsive than heavy drinkers. Indeed, Manning et al. (1995) found that the median drinker had a price elasticity of −1.19, whereas light and heavy drinkers’ price elasticities were around −0.5. Specifically, the price elasticity of the heaviest drinkers (those in the 95th percentile) was found to be not significantly different from zero. At the 80th percentile, however drinkers were still significantly responsive to price, with a price elasticity of −0.74. In a recent study, Farrell et al. (2003) argue that higher duties would reduce alcohol dependence and abuse, estimating a high price elasticity of −1.487. This confirms the results of an earlier study by Kenkel (1993), who estimated the demand for heavy drinking to be at least as price elastic as the demand for moderate drinking. -->

# Agriculture

I know we're not supposed to speak ill of that [most sacred American---the farmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMpZ0TGjbWE)---but modern intensive agriculture creates lots of external harms in the process of food production. Broadly, these harms can be categorized as harms to natural capital and harms to human health. They total up to $34 billion and are broken down in more detail in the following table:

The figures above are likely to underestimate the true size of external harms in agriculture:

<blockquote>
- some costs are known to be substantial underestimates (for example, acute and chronic pesticide poisoning of humans, monitoring costs, eutrophication of reservoirs and restoration of all hedgerow losses);
- some costs currently cannot be calculated (for example, dredging to maintain navigable water, flood defences, marine eutrophication and poisoning of domestic pets); 
- the costs of returning the environment or human health to pristine conditions were not calculated;
- treatment and prevention costs may be underestimates of how much people might be willing to pay to see positive externalities created; 
- the data do not account for time lags between the cause of a problem and its expression as a cost (i.e. some processes long since stopped may still be causing costs; some current practices may not yet have caused costs);
- this study did not include the externalities arising from transporting food from farms to manufacturers, processors, retailers and finally to consumers.

# Municipal waste

As the malodor makes obvious when passing by a garbage dump, municipal solid waste isn't entirely inert. It leaches into water and off-gases. These environmental harms are external to the initial disposal.

Unfortunately, as we get further down the list, finding good estimates of these costs gets harder and harder. [@repetto1992green] estimates non-market costs of [$135](http://www.in2013dollars.com/1992-dollars-in-2018?amount=75)/ton of municipal solid waste in high-cost areas and [$81](http://www.in2013dollars.com/1992-dollars-in-2018?amount=45)/ton in low-cost areas, but doesn't really show the work that leads up to this conclusion. The table below has a more detailed breakdown but the numbers are focused on Puerto Rico. Regardless, the final estimate of $77 in the table up top is the average of the average estimates from both sources (that is, $108/ton from [@repetto1992green] and $46/ton from [@miranda1999re]).

# Smoking

We finally reach the other classic sin tax---smoking. Surprisingly, there seems to be fairly widespread belief that cigarette taxes are, if anything, too high to be justified on purely Pigouvian grounds. [@manning1989] is the seminal paper in this area and it answers its titular question in the affirmative---smokers do pay their way. The basic mechanism is that while "nonsmokers subsidize smokers' medical care and group life insurance, smokers subsidize nonsmokers' pensions and nursing home payments" [@manning1989]. The breakdown showing this follows:

<figure>
<figcaption>External cost per pack of cigarettes, 2018 dollars</figcaption>

| Category                  | 0% discount rate | 3% discount rate | 5% discount rate |

| Group life insurance      |             0.42 |             0.24 |             0.16 |
| Nursing home care         |            -1.04 |            -0.40 |            -0.14 |

| Total net cost per pack   |            -2.85 |            -0.52 |             0.54 |

<figcaption>Data from [@viscusi1995cigarette] which calls it a reanalysis of [@manning1989]. Adjusted to [2018 dollars](http://www.in2013dollars.com/1993-dollars-in-2018?amount=1).</figcaption>
<!--[[file:~/code/colex/content/data/offline/pigou/smoking.org]]-->
</figure>

Even at a 5% discount rate, which produces the highest estimate of external harms (other discount rates actually suggest that cigarette consumption has net positive externalities), $0.54 per pack is less than the current federal cigarette tax of [$1.01 per pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_taxes_in_the_United_States).

All that said, there are several acknowledged omissions in these estimates. The big one is environmental tobacco smoke (ETS; secondhand smoke). At the time of the studies (and perhaps still?), the precise health effects of ETS were unknown so the costs weren't included in the above estimates. [@chaloupka2000economics] explains:

<blockquote>
The potential role of ETS costs in reevaluating the net negative externalities associated with smoking is seen by considering the following figures. Manning et al. (1991) noted that inclusion of the costs of 2,400 lung cancers from ETS (a fairly conservative estimate of this toll (Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) ) as external costs would add approximately 19 cents per pack in external costs (updated to 1994 dollars). In addition, inclusion of the costs of neonatal care for smoking-related low- birth-weight babies would add 3 cents to the total, while including fetal deaths attributable to smoking would add yet another 19 cents. Deaths from smoking-related fires would add a further 9 cents. The ETS costs would skyrocket if one included the estimated 30,000-60,000 heart disease deaths recently associated with ETS (Glantz and Parmley, 1995), adding perhaps 70 cents to the total social costs per pack. Similarly, inclusion of the smoking-induced respiratory tract infections and cases of aggravated asthma in children (Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) would boost the total further, as would inclusion of the long-term developmental disabilities in smoking-related low-birth-weight babies (Hay, 1991). All told, the social costs per pack could easily mount toward several dollars if all of the health hazards associated with ETS are real, many are treated as external to the basic consuming unit, and if all or even a significant fraction of the associated costs are included.
</blockquote>

# Antibiotics

The majority of antibiotics used in the US are used for animal agriculture (it's those beloved farmers again)---[18.4 million pounds in agriculture](https://assets.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/better-bacon-pork-industry-antibiotics-ib.pdf) compared to [7.0 million pounds in human medicine](https://assets.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/better-bacon-pork-industry-antibiotics-ib.pdf). Regardless, antibiotic use leads to [antibiotic resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance). This externality should be priced at "between 29 and 287€ per kilogram active substance or between 9 and 86% of the average price of commonly used antibiotics" [@vaagsholm2010]. Using the [2010 exchange rate EUR/USD exchange rate of 0.75](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/usd/USD-to-EUR-2010) and adjusting for [inflation](http://www.in2013dollars.com/2010-dollars-in-2018?amount=1), we find that this works out to $20--$201/lb of active substance. Picking the middle of the range produces the estimate of $110/lb used in the top table. The total cost calculated is in broad agreement with the estimated national cost of between $100 million and $30 million reported in [@rudholm2002economic].

# Debt

Somewhat non-obviously, borrowing also has external costs. "A borrower who has one more dollar of liquid net worth when the economy experiences a bust relaxes not only his private borrowing constraint but also the borrowing constraints of all other insiders. Not internalizing this spillover effect, the insider takes on too much debt during good times." [@jeanne2010managing]

On a percentage basis, this externality is small and [procyclical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyclical_and_countercyclical_variables)---0.56 percent of outstanding debt for small and medium enterprises in a boom and 0.48 percent of outstanding debt for households in a boom [@jeanne2010managing]. It only amounts to a sizable cost because the quantities of debt involved are so enormous. American households took on [$556 billion of new debt in the year up through Q3 of 2018](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html). SME outstanding debt totaled 5.34 trillion in 2009 [@jeanne2010managing] (I couldn't find info on the current rate of SME debt increase.).

# Guns

I couldn't find any direct estimates of the externalities of firearms so I threw together my own estimate. The key number I sought was the number of accidental firearm killings of another person. I ruled out self-killings as internalities (Which is not strictly correct. If a child accidentally kills themselves with their parent's gun, that's an externality.). I ruled out intentional killings on the grounds that some unknown fraction of these would still occur even in the absence of guns. Clearly though, the resulting estimate is a conceptual lower bound.

[@xu2016deaths] records 505 deaths from accidental discharge. [@hemenway2010unintentional] reports that in half of such fatalities, the victim was shot by another person.

In 2016, 16 million guns entered circulation in the U.S. (base on [11.5 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/215395/number-of-total-firearms-manufactured-in-the-us/) manufactured in the U.S., [376 thousand](https://www.statista.com/statistics/215562/number-of-exported-firearms-manufactured-in-the-us/) exported and [5.1 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/215644/number-of-imported-firearms-into-the-us-by-country/) imported).

Using an even [$9 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life#United_States) as the value of a statistical life, we find that the estimated cost of 252 deaths is around $2.26 billion. We divide by the 16 million guns entering circulation to get $134 per gun sale as an order of magnitude estimate of the appropriate Pigouvian tax.

# Soda

Even though the soda tax is a 'popular' policy, I couldn't find any serious attempts to estimate the optimal Pigouvian tax for soda. Any attempt would be complicated by the fact that the marginal cost of soda consumption varies widely but systematically across consumers [@fleischer2015curb]---it would be much higher for those at risk of type 2 diabetes, for example.

# Gambling

The three categories of external costs highlighted in [@clotfelter2005gambling] are:

Problem gamblers
:   Problems gamblers constitute ~2% of the adult population. They "driving themselves into bankruptcy, their families into hardship, and their personal relationships into ruin". Their are inevitably social costs which accompany these problems.
Undermines government credibility
:  "Government, through its schools, laws, and public pronouncements, advocates certain beliefs, including the value of productive work. To the extent that the sponsorship and, particularly, the promotion of gambling undercut that traditional message, legalized gambling creates a second category of external costs."
Organized crime
:  Lotteries don't seem to do much to encourage organized crime but other forms of legalized gambling may.

# Finance

The three categories of external costs highlighted in [@masur2015] are:

Speculation
:   "A transfer of money does not generate social value unless it is part of a transaction that reduces risk or otherwise enables people to spread receipts of money across times or states of the world in a way that advances their interests."

Races
:   "When new information about [current] events [...] comes into existence, market participants will scramble to be the first to trade on the information. [...] This activity is socially wasteful. [...] [T]he broader market will not benefit at all if information about terrorism, as embodied in market prices, reaches them a nanosecond quicker than it otherwise does."

Debt
:   "Short-term debt creates a negative externality. When a depositor or other short-term lender withdraws money, it increases the probability that the borrower will not have enough funds to pay other lenders when the loans are due or demanded. Those lenders will not be able to recover in full because of bankruptcy."
