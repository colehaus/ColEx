If voters have social preferences (second-order preferences about the preference satisfaction of others) and imperfect information, voting altruistically may produce worse outcomes---for the individual voter and for society at large---than ignoring their social preferences and voting egocentrically. This problem seems like it may actually be common in the real world. While I doubt any voting system can eliminate it, including information about private preferences in polls may ameliorate it.
