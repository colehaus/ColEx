::: {#key-terms}
d-separation
:   If and only if a pair of vertices is d-separated, they are independent. This happens if there is no unblocked path between the vertices.

d-connection
:   If a pair of vertices is dependent, they are d-connected. This happens when there is an unblocked path between the vertices.

Blocked path
:   A blocked path has at least one of:

      1. A collider where neither the collider nor its descendants are conditioned on; or
      2. A non-collider (i.e. a mediator or a confounder) that _is_ conditioned on.
