[Confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble), etc. mean that it's easy to convince yourself of falsehoods. I hope that explicitly devoting time and attention to ideas that aren't intuitively appealing or otherwise aligned with my worldview will help guard against this.

Also, this tag will likely include posts arguing against things that I don't actually believe, but that I probably appear to believe (e.g. economism).
