The "amateur" part isn't an entirely false modesty. I am indeed often summarizing works in areas where I have limited experience and I'm certainly not paid for it. As such, despite my best efforts, I will assuredly sometimes mangle the subject matter. Once we both acknowledge this, we're left with the question: Why bother to read or write these summaries?

# For you

I can think of a few reasons you might like to read these summaries despite those limitations:

## Curse of expertise

Experts [may]{.noted}[^dubious] be worse at explaining material than intermediate practitioners due to heuristics like [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) and [availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) [@hinds1999]. Anecdotally, it seems like professors who know the material _too_ well to explain it are a common experience. As someone who has just learned the material I'm summarizing, I may be well-positioned to explain it.

## Length

As the [perennial](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/) [popularity](https://sivers.org/book) of [summarizers](https://www.blinkist.com/) [attests](https://joosr.com/our-books), there's an audience for condensed versions of books. Existing summarizers seem to target self-help and management books though. I, on the other hand, expect to target a more niche and academic set of books. I'll somewhat cheekily summarize that as: If it's ever been on a best-seller list, don't expect to see it here.

## Style

Another reason you might prefer these summaries to the originals is their inimitable, insouciant style. In all seriousness, academic writing is a genre with conventions that aren't optimal for all purposes. While the writing here might sometimes seem a pitiable mockery of academic style, the academese here is an accident rather than a necessity. I'm very open to better conventions and will try to adopt them as I come upon them.

## Interactivity

I sometimes create novel, [interactive](/tag/interactive/) content to explain material. The feedback that interactivity can provide is pretty handy for learning [@hattie2007].

## Generalist

I strive to be a generalist. That means I may make connections to areas the source material doesn't. If you and I happen to share more reference points than you and the original author do, we may communicate better.

# For me

But I'll not pretend to be entirely unselfish here. A large part of my motivation for these summaries is to improve my own understanding. That is, I hope to use these summaries as an opportunity to construct [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)) and use the imagination effect [@sweller2008] to combat the illusion of explanatory depth [@rozenblit2002].

[^dubious]: If the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) has taught us anything, it's that we should take low N, [unregistered](https://cos.io/prereg/), unreplicated studies like these more as proposals than conclusions.
