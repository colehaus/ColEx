2. [Why Arabic Is Terrific](http://idlewords.com/2011/08/why_arabic_is_terrific.htm)

<blockquote>
Nearly all Arabic words consist of a three-consonant root slotted into a pattern of vowels and helper consonants. The root gives the word its base meaning, while the pattern modifies this meaning in a systematic and predictable way. This idea is so cool that you'd think it came from a constructed language, and yet Arabic has actual native speakers who live completely normal lives and will not try to talk to you about Runescape.

[...]

Here are some common patterns using the root <b>k t b</b>, whose basic meaning is 'writing':

| pattern   | pattern meaning      |         | result                |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :------ | :-------------------- |
| m--a-a    | place name           | مكتبة   | maktaba (library)     |
| -aa-i-    | active participle    | كاتب    | kaatib (writer)       |
| ma--uu-   | passive participle   | مكتوب   | maktuub (written)     |
| -a-a-a    | basic verb           | كتب     | kataba (to write)     |
| a--a-a    | causative verb       | أكتب    | aktaba (to dictate)   |
| -i-aa-    | noun                 | كتاب    | kitaab (book)         |
| -u-u-     | plural noun          | كتب     | kutub (books)         |

3. [No, it’s not The Incentives---it’s you](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/10/02/no-its-not-the-incentives-its-you/)

<blockquote>
In the last few years, I’ve noticed that uncomfortable discussions about questionable [research] practices disproportionately seem to end with a chuckle or shrug, followed by a comment to the effect that _we are all extremely sophisticated human beings who recognize the complexity of the world we live in, and sure it would be great if we lived in a world where one didn’t have to occasionally engage in shenanigans, but that would be extremely naive, and after all, we are not naive, are we?_


[...]

Imagine if every time you went to your doctor---and I’m aware that this analogy won’t work well for people living outside the United States---she sent you to get a dozen expensive and completely unnecessary medical tests, and then, when prompted for an explanation, simply shrugged and said "I know I’m not an angel---but hey, them’s The Incentives."

<blockquote>
"This prison gives me a sense of freedom," said Park Hye-ri, a 28-year-old office worker who paid $90 to spend 24 hours locked up in a mock prison.

[...]

Clients get a blue prison uniform, a yoga mat, tea set, a pen and notebook. They sleep on the floor. There is a small toilet inside the room, but no mirror.
