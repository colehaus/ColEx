We've spent a lot of time recently talking about Acemoglu and Robinson's work---in particular, about autocrats. Now, we'll try to turn our new understanding to constructive ends.

The second scheme is for the ICC to offer abdication 'credits' that reduce the severity of criminal punishment for autocrats in the event of voluntary abdication.
