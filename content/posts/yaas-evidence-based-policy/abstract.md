RCTs are good for producing claims like "It worked there.". But what we really care about is "Will it work here?". The standard answer to this question is [external validity](#the-standard-solution-external-validity), but EBP disapproves of this answer for a variety of reasons. Instead, they propose that we answer the question of generalization by thinking about [causal principles](#causal-principle), [causal roles and support factors](#causal-role-and-support-factors). To find support factors and the right causal principle, we must engage in, respectively, [horizontal search](#horizontal-search) and [vertical search](#vertical-search) up and down the ladder of abstraction.
