::: {#key-terms}
Chains
:   A → B → C

Forks
:   A ← B → C

Inverted forks
:   A → B ← C

Collider
:   The central node that the two causes on either side point to in an inverted fork.

d-separation
:   If a pair of vertices is d-separated, they are independent.

d-connection
:   If a pair of vertices is d-connected, they are (most likely) dependent.

Blocked path
:   A blocked path has a collider on it.
