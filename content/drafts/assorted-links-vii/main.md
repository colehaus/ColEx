The shortest-lived child of Prohibition actually survived to adulthood. This was the change in drinking patterns that depressed the level of consumption compared with the pre-Prohibition years. Straitened family finances during the Depression of course kept the annual per capita consumption rate low, hovering around 1.5 US gallons. The true results of Prohibition’s success in socializing Americans in temperate habits became apparent during World War II, when the federal government turned a more cordial face toward the liquor industry than it had during World War I, and they became even more evident during the prosperous years that followed.50 Although annual consumption rose, to about 2 gallons per capita in the 1950s and 2.4 gallons in the 1960s, it did not surpass the pre-Prohibition peak until the early 1970s.51

1.2.0	Perfect

In MUSE a distinction is made between present and past perfect (i.e., within the perfect aspect, tense is marked). Perfect means that the action is completed. AAVE has two additional markers for aspect which extend the perfect:

MUSE

AAVE

present perfect

I have walked

I have walked

past perfect

I had walked

I had walked

completive

n/a

I done walked

remote time

n/a

I been walked

(For examples and discussion, see 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 below.)

1.2.1	Deletion of auxiliary have

In MUSE the present and past tense forms of auxiliary have (=have and had), as used in the perfect, can be contracted, becoming /v/ and /s/ respectively. In AAVE, the contracted forms can also be deleted:

Full forms: MUSE & AAVE

Contracted: MUSE & AAVE

Deleted: AAVE only

I have walked

I’ve walked

I __ walked **

He has walked

He’s walked

He __ walked **

I have been here for hours

I’ve been here for hours

I __ been here for hours
