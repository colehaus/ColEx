Perhaps the best
example of a Pigouvian tax we have found is the Ozone Depleting
Chemicals Tax (ODC), which was implemented by Congress in 1989 in
order to comply with the Montreal Protocol.32 The ODC applies to the sale
or use of ozone-depleting chemicals and is assessed at a rate proportional to
their potential for depleting the ozone layer.33 Similarly, in the wake of the
Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Congress created an oil pollution fund, called
the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, to provide compensation to those who 
have suffered losses or damages due to an oil spill.34 The Fund is primarily
funded by a tax of five cents per barrel of oil produced and imported to the
United States. In addition, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act,
which was passed in order to mitigate the negative effects of coal mining on
the environment, imposes a tax on the extraction of coal from domestic
mines.35

# Finance

A third social cost of financial activity is the problem of gambling or
“speculation.”146 Financial transactions are different from transactions in the
“real economy” because they involve a pure transfer of money instead of the
exchange of money for goods or services. When one person buys an asset
from another—say, a share of stock—the buyer gains at the seller’s expense
or the seller gains at the buyer’s expense, depending on whether the price is
less than or greater than the true value of the asset. A transfer of money
does not generate social value unless it is part of a transaction that reduces
risk or otherwise enables people to spread receipts of money across times or
states of the world in a way that advances their interests. 

Imagine, for example, that one person sells a Greek sovereign bond to
another person. If the seller owns a huge amount of Greek assets while the
buyer owns none, the transaction could very well reduce the amount of risk
in both the seller’s and buyer’s portfolio (the seller’s, by reducing her
dependence on the value of Greek assets; the buyer’s, by diversifying a
portfolio that is loaded with assets in other countries). If it does reduce
their risk, the transaction also decreases the total amount of risk in the
economy. But if the seller and buyer are in opposite positions, the
transaction will increase risk. The seller and buyer are simply gambling
about what will happen in Greece—the seller believes that Greece may
default, while the buyer believes that Greece will not default. Their
behavior is not any different from people betting on horses.
Some commentators see no problem with such gambling, but there are
several reasons to be concerned about the motivations underlying the
transaction. First, if the buyer and seller are rational and risk averse (as is
usually assumed), the transaction can take place only if they are gambling
with other people’s money. One possibility is that each person represents an
institution that is guaranteed by the government. Another possibility is that
they are agents for funds whose investors do not carefully monitor their
behavior, and who have contracts that give them payoffs if they make
money while not forcing them to fully absorb losses.
Second, if the buyer and seller are risk averse, but poorly informed or
boundedly rational, they may enter the transaction believing that each has
special insight about the likely direction of the value of the asset when in
fact they do not. In such a case, the transaction is just a wasteful transfer
from one person to another, and there is no reason for society to tolerate it.
Third, if the buyer and seller are rational but not risk averse (e.g., they
enjoy gambling) then it is almost certainly better to direct them to casinos
than to allow them to gamble using the financial system. Casinos are heavily
regulated because governments recognize that people may develop an
addiction to gambling and subsequently act against their interest. Casinos
are also not vulnerable to financial panics and systemic risk. Financial
institutions are. Accordingly, the government should discourage purely
speculative activity that takes place in the financial system. 

A second example of the social cost of financial activity is the problem of
“races,” first identified by Jack Hirshleifer.141 The value of an asset is a
function of information about the various factors that affect the supply and
demand of that asset. For example, the price of oil depends on information
about the prospect of war in the Middle East or the likelihood of continued
economic prosperity in China. When new information about events like
these comes into existence, market participants will scramble to be the first
to trade on the information.
To understand why, suppose that a barrel of oil currently trades at $100.
A terrorist attack destroys a pipeline in an obscure part of the world and
raises the possibility of additional disruption of the oil supply. When the
market learns of the attack, the price of oil will rise to $105. Any person who
learns about the terrorist attack first, can buy oil (or oil futures or other
derivatives) at $100 and reap a quick profit of $5 per barrel by selling when
the price rises.
The prospect of such profits will encourage investors to spend money to
obtain information about events before others. Investors have spent vast
sums to construct fiberoptic cables that increase the flow of information by
nanoseconds. For example, Spread Networks, a high-speed trading firm,
paid $300 million to build cables from New York to Chicago so that they
could trade on the Chicago exchange using New York information
microseconds before the market learned the information.142 Investors have
purchased and leased buildings close to exchanges for the same reason.143
This activity is socially wasteful.144 To see why, consider first why it is
valuable for information to spread at a relatively speedy rate. If terrorism is 
increasing, then oil will become more expensive because it will be harder to
produce and ship. If the market learns this information quickly, then
airlines, trucking companies, consumers, and others can quickly adjust by
engaging in alternative activities—for example, by relying more on
electricity. However, the key point is that the broader market will not
benefit at all if information about terrorism, as embodied in market prices,
reaches them a nanosecond quicker than it otherwise does. Thus, high-speed
investors incur expenses in a socially wasteful race.
 This problem can be addressed with a Pigouvian tax. The economist
James Tobin famously advocated just such a tax, now known as a Tobin tax,
on financial transactions.145 Because high-speed traders make tiny profits on
numerous trades, a tax on each trade would deter them from much of their
wasteful activity. But because the Tobin tax is low, it will not deter valuable
financial transactions.

Banks and other financial institutions frequently fund themselves
through very short-term debt, including debt that is due on demand.
Commercial banks heavily rely on deposit accounts, where customers park
funds for short periods in return for interest and checking services, and can
also withdraw those funds at any time. Commercial banks and other
financial institutions—including investment banks—also fund themselves
through the repo market. In this market, large institutions, like pension
funds, make short-term (one- or two-day) collateralized loans that are
routinely rolled over. “Withdrawing” effectively occurs when the lender
refuses to roll over a loan because it prefers to invest those funds elsewhere.
Short-term debt creates a negative externality.135 When a depositor or
other short-term lender withdraws money, it increases the probability that
the borrower will not have enough funds to pay other lenders when the
loans are due or demanded. Those lenders will not be able to recover in full
because of bankruptcy. To protect themselves, lenders may withdraw funds
in response to other lenders withdrawing their funds, leading to a run. The
firm may be forced to sell assets into a declining market, resulting in losses.
If firms are shut down, then real value consisting of the firm’s private
information and contacts may be lost.136 And if the collapse of one firm 
leads to the collapse of other firms, resulting in a full-blown contagion of
the sort seen in 2008, the sudden massive withdrawal of credit from the
economy can cause severe macroeconomic effects, including unemployment.
The government tries to deter runs by requiring banks to offer FDIC
insurance to depositors and by acting as a lender of last resort.137 The idea is
that if short-term lenders know that the government will protect them, they
are less likely to jump the gun and withdraw. However, government
insurance creates a new problem in the form of moral hazard. Because
financial institutions expect to be rescued, they will take greater risk,
enjoying the upside if the risk pays off and transferring the loss to the
government if it does not. Moreover, even if deposit insurance were
correctly priced, or creditors adequately monitored financial institutions,
every institution would still create a negative externality from risk-taking
behavior by increasing the probability of default and losses to other institutions,
which could in turn trigger a system-wide collapse with negative
effects for the economy.138
As John Cochrane has argued, the simplest response to this problem is a
Pigouvian tax.139 Every time a bank borrows $100, there is a tiny increase in
the risk of a run that could result in a financial crisis.140 Although the risk is
tiny, the losses associated with financial crisis are huge, so the tax itself may
well be substantial. Cochrane suggests a tax of five percent—meaning that
the bank would be required to pay $5 to the government for every $100 it
borrows, with the precise amount depending on various factors including
the maturity of the debt. 

[@masur2015]

Thus, it is worth asking what costs an optimal Pigouvian tax would require the form to take into account. Relevant items would include the expected costs to (1) uninsured counter-parties from firm insolvency, (2) taxpayers and beneficiaries of government programmes, present and future, who would be worse off to the extent the government offered explicit or implicit insurance coverage, and (3) anyone else directly or indirectly affected by the heightened prospect of runs on the bank (at the same firm or elsewhere) and/or of the negative economic consequences from the associated harm to the liquidity function that banks and other financial firms serve in facilitating transactions that generate surplus.

# Antibiotics

The magnitude the tax based on European Union numbers ranges between 29 and 287€ per kilogram active substance or between 9 and 86% of the average price of commonly used antibiotics depending on the foreseen period in years (1–10 years) between the development of a new antibiotic drug.

# Smoking

Although nonsmokers subsidize smokers' medical care and group life insurance, smokers subsidize nonsmokers' pensions and nursing home payments. On balance, smokers probably pay their way at the current level of excise taxes on cigarettes

[@manning1989]

# Alcohol

The widely cited study by Leung and Phelps (1993) reviewed the results of studies estimating the price elasticity of alcohol demand. Although the studies show considerable variation, the broad pattern of results would be consistent with elasticities of -0.3 for beer, -1.0 for wine, and -1.5 for spirits.

Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998) find that the long-run elasticity in a model with addiction is some 50 per cent higher than the short-run elasticity

The most widely quoted US estimates of alcohol consumption externalities, appropriately defined, are those of Manning et al. (1989), who estimate that net external costs are equivalent in value to about 35 per cent of the producer price of alcohol. A very large proportion of the next external cost is accounted for by the valuation of alcohol-related traffic fatalities.

A very large proportion of the net external cost is accounted for by the valuation of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Since the number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities seems to vary quite widely across countries, this would suggest that these US estimates may not be a good indication of alcohol externalities in other countries. Parry (2001) notes that there are fewer serious alcohol-related traffic accidents in the UK than in the USA, and that the marginal external costs are consequently also likely to be lower in the UK.

In a pioneering study, Manning et al. (1989) estimated the net external costs in the mid-1980s at about US$0.48 per ounce of ethanol, double the average state and federal tax per ounce that was then in place. A similar result was reported by Pogue and Sgontz (1989). Much of the external costs were borne by victims of drunk drivers. The costs would have been higher still had non-fatal highway injuries (Miller and Blincoe 1994) and intra-family effects been taken into account. Furthermore, Kenkel (1996) estimated that the duty rate should be about equal to the pre-tax alcohol price, while Saffer and Chaloupka (1994) calculated the weighted average optimal US tax on alcohol at 2.3 times the 1991 level.

One of the most widely cited studies, by Leung and Phelps (1993), concludes that the price elasticities of alcohol demand are −0.3 for beer, −1.0 for wine and −1.5 for spirits. Clements et al. (1997) report price elasticities for seven countries (including three EU member states, i.e. Finland, Sweden and the UK), covering the period from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s. They find elasticities of −0.35 for beer, −0.68 for wine and −0.98 for spirits, which are broadly in line with those found for the US.

Intuitively, moderate drinkers should be more price responsive than heavy drinkers. Indeed, Manning et al. (1995) found that the median drinker had a price elasticity of −1.19, whereas light and heavy drinkers’ price elasticities were around −0.5. Specifically, the price elasticity of the heaviest drinkers (those in the 95th percentile) was found to be not significantly different from zero. At the 80th percentile, however drinkers were still significantly responsive to price, with a price elasticity of −0.74. In a recent study, Farrell et al. (2003) argue that higher duties would reduce alcohol dependence and abuse, estimating a high price elasticity of −1.487. This confirms the results of an earlier study by Kenkel (1993), who estimated the demand for heavy drinking to be at least as price elastic as the demand for moderate drinking.

As noted above, however, nearly all external costs are caused by 10% of the drinking
population who consume one-third to one-half of all alcohol sold.

# Fat

On 1 October 2011, the Danish Fat Tax Act came into effect.21 The tax of DKK 16 (around EUR 2.15) per kilogram of saturated fat is imposed on all food products produced in and imported into Denmark. The scope of the new legislation is established in Article 1 of the Act, which specifies that the following products are taxable: meat, certain dairy products, animal fats, edible oils and other fats, margarine, spreadable composite products, and other products which can be considered as substitutes or imitations of the above. The tax does not apply to products containing less than 2.3% per weight of saturated fat, which means that most types of milk are exempt.

# Carbon tax

One of the most prominent economists studying this topic is Yale’s Bill Nordhaus. Nordhaus [2007] has suggested a tax of $30 per ton of carbon, increasing to about $85 in 2050. A $30 carbon tax is fairly modest in size: it would increase the price of gasoline by only about 8 cents per gallon.

With these assumptions, Nordhaus concludes that a carbon tax starting at $7.40/ton of CO2 is optimal, so long as it increases by 2-3% a year in real terms (after inflation) until 2050, with steeper increases after that.

By contrast, the economist Nicholas Stern [2006] reached a very different conclusion in a study prominently released by the British government. Stern estimates the external cost of carbon emission at over $300 per ton — more than 10 times the Nordhaus number.

In his paper, A Green Employment Tax Swap: Using A Carbon Tax to Finance Payroll Tax Relief, published jointly by the Brookings Institution and the World Resources Institute, Metcalf recommends a carbon tax just under $17/ton of CO2.

Among these more rigorous analyses, the average or mean value of this measure was $50 per metric ton of carbon or $13.64 per metric ton of CO2." 

The mode is $220 per ton of carbon for a 0 percent PRTP, $93 per ton of carbon for a 1 percent PRTP, and $28 per ton of carbon for a 3 percent PRTP.

# Driving tax

One of them is carbon emissions, as I have been discussing. 

Another is local pollution, such as smog.

A third external cost is congestion. Every time I am stuck in traffic, I wish my fellow motorists would drive less, perhaps by living closer to where they work or by taking public transport. And they might well be thinking the same about me. In essence, each of us is imposing external costs on everyone else.

A fourth external cost is accidents and the higher insurance rates we all pay. That is, when I choose to drive, I make it more likely that I will be in an accident. That is, of course, an internal cost that I fully take into account when deciding whether to take my car out of the garage. But, in addition, when I drive, I make it more likely that you will be in an accident. That is an external cost, which from an economic standpoint is equivalent to pollution. The numbers here are staggering. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are more than 30 million traffic accidents a year. It estimates that the annual dollar cost of accidents, including property damage and personal injury, amounts to more than $400 billion a year.

There is a large literature that tries to put numbers on each of these external costs of driving. An article published in the Journal of Economic Literature in June 2007 summarized many studies and concluded that the optimal Pigovian tax on gasoline was $2.10 per gallon [Parry et al. 2007]. That is well above the current level of taxation in the United States, which is about 40 cents a gallon.

2.7.1 Noise. Unwanted automobile noise includes engine acceleration, tire/road contact, braking, etc. Noise costs have been quantified by estimating the effect of proximity to roads, and traffic volumes, on residential property values holding other variables constant (however it is difficult to control for natural and intended noise mitigation barriers, such as hills, sound-proof walls, double glazed windows). For example, Delucchi and Shi-Lang (1998) estimate costs between 0 and 0.4 cents per vehicle mile across different road classes, while US FHWA (1997), Table V22, put external costs at 0.06 cents per mile for passenger vehicles.

2.7.2 Highway Maintenance Costs. Analysts have estimated the effect of axle loads and traffic volumes on pavement damage for different vehicle classes, controlling for other factors (e.g., pavement age, climate). The key finding is that a vehicle causes road wear at a rate that is a sharply increasing function of the weight per axle, so that virtually all damage is attributed to heavy-duty trucks (e.g., Small et al. 1989, Newbery 1988). For example, US FHWA (1997), Table V-9, put external costs per mile at 0.06-0.08 cents per mile for passenger vehicles, and 1.59 and 2.78 cents per mile for the average single unit and combination truck respectively.

2.7.3 Urban sprawl. Many authors have argued that the low cost of motor vehicle use encourages urban sprawl (e.g., Brueckner 2000, Glaeser and Kahn 2003, Glaeser and Kohlhase 2003); in turn this may cause additional traffic congestion as well as lost natural habitat and aesthetic benefits from open space. However, there is little consensus on either the magnitude of increased external costs, or the relation between vehicle miles and development (e.g., McConnell and Walls 2005, Crane 1999). Moreover, if sprawl is excessive in specific regions this is primarily due to the failure of land-use policies, particularly development fees and zoning restrictions, to fully account for the external and infrastructure costs of new development.

2.7.4 Parking Subsidies. Many individuals park for free when they work or shop; Litman (2003) puts the costs from these parking subsidies at a substantial 3−10 cents per vehicle mile. Again though there remains dispute over whether free parking should be attributed as an external cost of automobile use as it results from other policy distortions, notably the exemption of the value of free parking from income and payroll taxes that apply to ordinary wage compensation.

2.7.5 Other environmental externalities. Improper disposal of vehicles and vehicle parts (e.g., tires, batteries, oil) can result in environmental and health hazards; however Lee (1993) put these costs at only 0.0015 cents per vehicle mile, and they have probably declined with more stringent regulations governing disposal and recycling. Damages from upstream emissions leakage from 15 the petroleum industry are also relatively small, around 2 cents per gallon according to NRC (2002).

## Distributional

A 1991 study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist James Poterba called ‘‘Is the Gasoline Tax Regressive?’’ concluded that ‘‘low-expenditure households devote a smaller share of their budget to gasoline than do their counterparts in the middle of the expenditure distribution.’’ The poor are far more likely than higher-income households to ride the bus or subway to work.

## Total

annual gasoline consumption per capita is around 470 gallons in the United States, with its low population density and limited transit availability, compared with only 90 gallons in western Europe

## Revenue

Numerous studies have estimated the own-price elasticity of gasoline demand for the United States and other countries. Most studies regress gasoline consumption on price, income, and other variables (e.g., vehicle ownership and characteristics), using time series data, sometimes with a lag structure imposed, or cross-section data. A decade or so ago, reviews pointed to a long run gasoline demand elasticity of around –0.7 to –1.0 (Dahl and Sterner 1991, Table 2, Goodwin 1992, Table 1, Espey 1996, Table 4). Later US studies that better control for fuel economy regulations, correlation among explanatory variables, or correlation among vehicle age, use and fuel economy, suggest a less elastic response. Another factor may be the declining share of fuel costs in total travel costs as wages, and hence the value of travel time, rise over time. US DOE (1996) proposed a value for the long run fuel price elasticity of –0.38, though other recent reviews by Goodwin et al. (2004) and Glaister and Graham (2002) put the elasticity at –0.7 and –0.6 respectively.
