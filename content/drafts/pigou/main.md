Excise taxes are relatively small but non-trivial sources of revenue. On average across the OECD, they account for almost 11 percent of government revenues

Perhaps the best example of a Pigouvian tax we have found is the Ozone Depleting Chemicals Tax (ODC), which was implemented by Congress in 1989 in order to comply with the Montreal Protocol.32 The ODC applies to the sale or use of ozone-depleting chemicals and is assessed at a rate proportional to their potential for depleting the ozone layer.33 Similarly, in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Congress created an oil pollution fund, called the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, to provide compensation to those who have suffered losses or damages due to an oil spill.34 The Fund is primarily funded by a tax of five cents per barrel of oil produced and imported to the United States. In addition, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which was passed in order to mitigate the negative effects of coal mining on the environment, imposes a tax on the extraction of coal from domestic mines.35

# Soda

In economic terms, the consumption of sugary beverages creates a social cost—obesity-related healthcare—that is not a component of a good’s price.113 As one commentator has put it, “[I]ndividuals acting in their own self-interest . . . will not effectively address the problem [of obesity] because they do not internalize some of the major costs or benefits of action or nonaction.”

# Agriculture

The environmental and human health effects of modern agriculture are wide-ranging and well documented (Conway & Pretty, 1991; Altieri, 1995; Pretty, 1995, 1998; Mason, 1996; European Environment Agency (EEA), 1998), and include: (1) pesticides contaminating water and harming wildlife and human health; (2) nitrate and phosphate from fertilizers, livestock wastes and silage effluents contaminating water, and so contributing to algal blooms, deoxygenation, fish deaths and nuisance to leisure users; (3) soil erosion disrupting watercourses, and run-off from eroded land causing flooding and damage to housing and natural resources; (4) harm to consumers exposed to harmful residues and micro-organisms in foods; and (5) contamination of the atmospheric environment by methane, nitrous oxide and ammonia derived from livestock, their manures and fertilizers.

For a variety of reasons, these estimates are likely to be conservative (Pretty et al., 2000): · some costs are known to be substantial underestimates (for example, acute and chronic pesticide poisoning of humans, monitoring costs, eutrophication of reservoirs and restoration of all hedgerow losses); · some costs currently cannot be calculated (for example, dredging to maintain navigable water, flood defences, marine eutrophication and poisoning of domestic pets); · the costs of returning the environment or human health to pristine conditions were not calculated; · treatment and prevention costs may be underestimates of how much people might be willing to pay to see positive externalities created; · the data do not account for time lags between the cause of a problem and its expression as a cost (i.e. some processes long since stopped may still be causing costs; some current practices may not yet have caused costs); · this study did not include the externalities arising from transporting food from farms to manufacturers, processors, retailers and finally to consumers.

# Credit

A borrower who has one more dollar of liquid net worth when the economy experiences a bust relaxes not only his private borrowing constraint but also the borrowing constraints of all other insiders. Not internalizing this spillover effect, the insider takes on too much debt during good times.

It is important that the level of the tax on a given sector be adjusted to its vulnerability to credit and asset price busts. In a benchmark calibration of our model to the US small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector, we find that the optimal tax converges to 0.56 percent of the amount of debt outstanding over the course of a boom, and drops to zero when a bust occurs. Borrowing by the US household sector is subject to externalities of similar magnitude (0.48 percent in booms). By contrast, US Flow of Funds data over the past decade suggest that large corporations who have access to corporate bond markets were less subject to systemic externalities and did not require macro-prudential measures.

agents do not internalize that their borrowing choices in boom times render the economy more vulnerable to credit and asset price busts involving debt deflation in bust times. Therefore their borrowing imposes an externality on the economy. In our baseline calibration, a social planner would impose on average an ex-ante tax of half a percent per dollar on borrowing so as to reduce the debt burden and mitigate the decline in consumption in case of crisis.

# Garbage

In particular, the Tellus Institute (1991) studies the full cost of An Excise Tax on Municipal Solid Waste? 171 waste disposal for the state of California, employing the ‘control cost’ method of pollutant evaluation for the external costs. Under that method, the marginal external damage (MED) attributed to a specific pollutant is the cost of preventing a marginal unit of that pollutant from entering the environment

For the UK, the Centre for Social and Economic Research of the Global Environment (1993) found external costs of £1.30 to £4.00 per ton, depending on whether the landfill has energy recovery from methane gas.

For the Netherlands, Dijkgraaf and Vollebergh (1998) estimate that the external cost of landfill garbage is $US28 per ton (about $US0.28 per 32-gallon bag of garbage).

The external costs can include aesthetic costs incurred by individuals, such as the noise pollution from the collection trucks and a less scenic view. So far, no studies have estimated these aesthetic costs per unit of solid waste.28 The external cost also includes the negative health effects from toxins in the leachate that seeps into the groundwater. It includes the effect of methane gas produced as organic material in the landfill decomposes. Before methane was collected and vented, it could seep through crevices underground, emerge in some neighbouring house or basement, and then possibly ignite and explode. That danger has been virtually eliminated and is not part of calculations here. If the methane is vented and released into the atmosphere, then external costs include the greenhouse effect on global warming. Finally, if the methane is ‘flared’, as required on all new landfills, then the high greenhouse effect of the methane is reduced to the lower greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide (but the flaring creates other air emissions).

The first entry, under water emissions, is the range for leachate’s environmental costs. Leachate is produced from the interaction between degrading landfill material and water from precipitation. It contains toxins that may contaminate groundwater. For present purposes, leachate is a local water pollutant that will be linked with the precipitation level in each state.30 Because of recent controls, however, the range in the table is small ($0.0–$1.0 per ton of waste).

Under air emissions, methane is the biggest potential problem. In fact, landfills are the source of 35 per cent of methane emissions in the USA, or 4 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions (Environmental Protection Agency, 2001). More is said about the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, because so much more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere from industries and vehicles that burn fossil fuels, but each methane gas molecule has much more greenhouse effect than a carbon dioxide molecule. Thus the row of the table for methane shows a high range of costs from the greenhouse effect ($8.8–$59.5 per ton). If the methane is flared, however, then the combustion converts the methane into carbon dioxide and other air emissions, so the effect of methane from the landfill is much reduced ($2.1–$6.9 per ton). On the other hand, that flaring creates more carbon dioxide, and so the range of estimated costs from carbon dioxide increases (from $0.4--$1.4 per ton to $0.7--$2.0 per ton). These global costs of the two greenhouse gases are not specific to any state’s temperature or precipitation.

# Gambling

Further complicating the assessment of the efficiency of gambling taxes are externalities that arise from gambling. Probably the most serious of these arises from the apparent social fact that there exist some individuals who are especially susceptible to the temptation to gamble excessively. Compulsive gamblers, their gambling stimulated by easy accessibility to opportunities to bet, may spend enormous amounts, driving themselves into bankruptcy, their families into hardship, and their personal relationships into ruin. They are estimated to be of the order of 1–2 per cent of the adult population in countries where surveys have been conducted. Other ‘problem gamblers’ constitute another 2–4 per cent (Azmier, 2001, p. 10; Volberg, 2001, p. 49). Together, these two groups appear to constitute a small but stubbornly resilient share of the adult population. Research on gambling by these groups suggests that the harmful effects can be mitigated through restrictions on types of games, conditions of play, and marketing, but most experts would agree that legalization will inevitably make life worse for this small subset of the population. Accordingly, most governments that sponsor or allow gambling also provide services to help problem gamblers. This being an inevitable social cost associated with legalized gambling, the logic of Pigouvian taxation implies that gambling taxes reflect, in part, this cost.

A second category of social cost is less visible and probably less severe; it may even be illusory. Some commentators argue that the legalization of gambling, especially when it is endorsed and advertised by the government, may impose a cost to society by undercutting the educational function of government. Government, through its schools, laws, and public pronouncements, advocates certain beliefs, including the value of productive work. To the extent that the sponsorship and, particularly, the promotion of gambling undercut that traditional message, legalized gambling creates a second category of external costs. By the same logic of Pigouvian taxation, these costs would imply higher gambling taxes. This justification is similar to the time-honoured argument for sumptuary laws and ‘sin taxes’. Arising out of religious or moral disapproval, sumptuary laws dating from the ancient Greeks have been used to restrict or forbid certain kinds of consumption.

One last form of external cost associated with legalized gambling is crime, specifically organized crime. Although government-operated lotteries do not appear to have attracted or stimulated organized crime activity, some other aspects of the gaming industry have. As with other aspects of social cost, the design and regulation of legalized games will have a major impact on the severity of social costs.

# Obesity

In addition, Finkelstein et al. (2009) found that, across all payers, the obese spend $1,429 more per year on medical services, or roughly 42% more than those of normal weight, and that Medicare and Medicaid financed more than half of the expenditures attributable to obesity

externalities and associated deadweight losses may arise through publicly financed health insurance or other public medical expenditures that offset private health-care costs otherwise borne by individuals, such as expenditures through Medicare and Medicaid. In the first section of the paper, we review the somewhat terse literature on whether obesity is associated with externalities. We propose that a measure of the marginal increase in public-health expenditure associated with a change in obesity prevalence is a useful first-order estimate of both the marginal external cost and the marginal excess burden on the economy, or deadweight loss, arising from excess weight among the population.

We estimate that a 1-unit increase in BMI for every adult in the United States would increase annual public medical expenditures (i.e., direct medical costs) by $38.7 billion; an average marginal cost of $175 per year per unit of BMI for each adult in the United States. We further estimate that if every adult who is currently obese (BMI ≥ 30) had a BMI of 25 instead, then annual public medical expenditures would be reduced by $173.7 billion (in constant 2008$). This estimate implies that obesity accounted for 17.2% of annual public medical expenditures in 2008. Using the same results, if we assume further that a BMI of 25 represents the social optimum in the sense that the marginal social benefit associated with behavior giving rise to obesity equals the marginal social cost, we predict that U.S. adults classified as obese in 2008 imposed a net social cost, or deadweight loss of $203.6 billion in 2008. Using data from the National Health Expenditure Accounts, Finkelstein et al. (2009) estimated that obesity accounted for $61.8 million in Medicaid and Medicare, the two largest components of public medical expenditures (see Exhibit 4 in Finkelstein et al. 2009). Our estimates imply a significantly larger publicly financed cost of obesity mainly because we allow for non-linearities in the relationship between BMI and medical expenditures.

# Fat

On 1 October 2011, the Danish Fat Tax Act came into effect.21 The tax of DKK 16 (around EUR 2.15) per kilogram of saturated fat is imposed on all food products produced in and imported into Denmark. The scope of the new legislation is established in Article 1 of the Act, which specifies that the following products are taxable: meat, certain dairy products, animal fats, edible oils and other fats, margarine, spreadable composite products, and other products which can be considered as substitutes or imitations of the above. The tax does not apply to products containing less than 2.3% per weight of saturated fat, which means that most types of milk are exempt.

# Guns

In 2016, 38,658 people died from firearm-related injuries in the United States. On top of that, the U.S. saw 116,414 nonfatal injuries. While those numbers are sobering on their own, these deaths and injuries come with financial costs. Calculating those costs can be difficult, though. Different analyses use “widely differing accounting principles and procedures.”

For purposes of this analysis, though, there are three main categories of costs that derive from gun violence: the cost of personal injury and death, the cost of damage to property, and the cost of first responders.

A total of 398 people died from unintentional firearm injuries in the NVDRS jurisdictions over the 4-year period. In 35 cases (9%), it was unknown whether the shooting was inflicted by self or other, so these cases were set aside, leaving a final dataset of 363 deaths. In almost half of these fatalities, the victim was shot by another person (Table 2).

# Finance

A third social cost of financial activity is the problem of gambling or “speculation.” Financial transactions are different from transactions in the “real economy” because they involve a pure transfer of money instead of the exchange of money for goods or services. When one person buys an asset from another—say, a share of stock—the buyer gains at the seller’s expense or the seller gains at the buyer’s expense, depending on whether the price is less than or greater than the true value of the asset. A transfer of money does not generate social value unless it is part of a transaction that reduces risk or otherwise enables people to spread receipts of money across times or states of the world in a way that advances their interests.

Imagine, for example, that one person sells a Greek sovereign bond to another person. If the seller owns a huge amount of Greek assets while the buyer owns none, the transaction could very well reduce the amount of risk in both the seller’s and buyer’s portfolio (the seller’s, by reducing her dependence on the value of Greek assets; the buyer’s, by diversifying a portfolio that is loaded with assets in other countries). If it does reduce their risk, the transaction also decreases the total amount of risk in the economy. But if the seller and buyer are in opposite positions, the transaction will increase risk. The seller and buyer are simply gambling about what will happen in Greece—the seller believes that Greece may default, while the buyer believes that Greece will not default. Their behavior is not any different from people betting on horses. Some commentators see no problem with such gambling, but there are several reasons to be concerned about the motivations underlying the transaction. First, if the buyer and seller are rational and risk averse (as is usually assumed), the transaction can take place only if they are gambling with other people’s money. One possibility is that each person represents an institution that is guaranteed by the government. Another possibility is that they are agents for funds whose investors do not carefully monitor their behavior, and who have contracts that give them payoffs if they make money while not forcing them to fully absorb losses. Second, if the buyer and seller are risk averse, but poorly informed or boundedly rational, they may enter the transaction believing that each has special insight about the likely direction of the value of the asset when in fact they do not. In such a case, the transaction is just a wasteful transfer from one person to another, and there is no reason for society to tolerate it. Third, if the buyer and seller are rational but not risk averse (e.g., they enjoy gambling) then it is almost certainly better to direct them to casinos than to allow them to gamble using the financial system. Casinos are heavily regulated because governments recognize that people may develop an addiction to gambling and subsequently act against their interest. Casinos are also not vulnerable to financial panics and systemic risk. Financial institutions are. Accordingly, the government should discourage purely speculative activity that takes place in the financial system.

A second example of the social cost of financial activity is the problem of “races,” first identified by Jack Hirshleifer. The value of an asset is a function of information about the various factors that affect the supply and demand of that asset. For example, the price of oil depends on information about the prospect of war in the Middle East or the likelihood of continued economic prosperity in China. When new information about events like these comes into existence, market participants will scramble to be the first to trade on the information. To understand why, suppose that a barrel of oil currently trades at $100. A terrorist attack destroys a pipeline in an obscure part of the world and raises the possibility of additional disruption of the oil supply. When the market learns of the attack, the price of oil will rise to $105. Any person who learns about the terrorist attack first, can buy oil (or oil futures or other derivatives) at $100 and reap a quick profit of $5 per barrel by selling when the price rises. The prospect of such profits will encourage investors to spend money to obtain information about events before others. Investors have spent vast sums to construct fiberoptic cables that increase the flow of information by nanoseconds. For example, Spread Networks, a high-speed trading firm, paid $300 million to build cables from New York to Chicago so that they could trade on the Chicago exchange using New York information microseconds before the market learned the information. Investors have purchased and leased buildings close to exchanges for the same reason.143 This activity is socially wasteful.144 To see why, consider first why it is valuable for information to spread at a relatively speedy rate. If terrorism is increasing, then oil will become more expensive because it will be harder to produce and ship. If the market learns this information quickly, then airlines, trucking companies, consumers, and others can quickly adjust by engaging in alternative activities—for example, by relying more on electricity. However, the key point is that the broader market will not benefit at all if information about terrorism, as embodied in market prices, reaches them a nanosecond quicker than it otherwise does. Thus, high-speed investors incur expenses in a socially wasteful race. This problem can be addressed with a Pigouvian tax. The economist James Tobin famously advocated just such a tax, now known as a Tobin tax, on financial transactions.145 Because high-speed traders make tiny profits on numerous trades, a tax on each trade would deter them from much of their wasteful activity. But because the Tobin tax is low, it will not deter valuable financial transactions.

Banks and other financial institutions frequently fund themselves through very short-term debt, including debt that is due on demand. Commercial banks heavily rely on deposit accounts, where customers park funds for short periods in return for interest and checking services, and can also withdraw those funds at any time. Commercial banks and other financial institutions—including investment banks—also fund themselves through the repo market. In this market, large institutions, like pension funds, make short-term (one- or two-day) collateralized loans that are routinely rolled over. “Withdrawing” effectively occurs when the lender refuses to roll over a loan because it prefers to invest those funds elsewhere. Short-term debt creates a negative externality.135 When a depositor or other short-term lender withdraws money, it increases the probability that the borrower will not have enough funds to pay other lenders when the loans are due or demanded. Those lenders will not be able to recover in full because of bankruptcy. To protect themselves, lenders may withdraw funds in response to other lenders withdrawing their funds, leading to a run. The firm may be forced to sell assets into a declining market, resulting in losses. If firms are shut down, then real value consisting of the firm’s private information and contacts may be lost.136 And if the collapse of one firm leads to the collapse of other firms, resulting in a full-blown contagion of the sort seen in 2008, the sudden massive withdrawal of credit from the economy can cause severe macroeconomic effects, including unemployment. The government tries to deter runs by requiring banks to offer FDIC insurance to depositors and by acting as a lender of last resort.137 The idea is that if short-term lenders know that the government will protect them, they are less likely to jump the gun and withdraw. However, government insurance creates a new problem in the form of moral hazard. Because financial institutions expect to be rescued, they will take greater risk, enjoying the upside if the risk pays off and transferring the loss to the government if it does not. Moreover, even if deposit insurance were correctly priced, or creditors adequately monitored financial institutions, every institution would still create a negative externality from risk-taking behavior by increasing the probability of default and losses to other institutions, which could in turn trigger a system-wide collapse with negative effects for the economy. As John Cochrane has argued, the simplest response to this problem is a Pigouvian tax.139 Every time a bank borrows $100, there is a tiny increase in the risk of a run that could result in a financial crisis.140 Although the risk is tiny, the losses associated with financial crisis are huge, so the tax itself may well be substantial. Cochrane suggests a tax of five percent—meaning that the bank would be required to pay $5 to the government for every $100 it borrows, with the precise amount depending on various factors including the maturity of the debt.

[@masur2015]

Thus, it is worth asking what costs an optimal Pigouvian tax would require the form to take into account. Relevant items would include the expected costs to (1) uninsured counter-parties from firm insolvency, (2) taxpayers and beneficiaries of government programmes, present and future, who would be worse off to the extent the government offered explicit or implicit insurance coverage, and (3) anyone else directly or indirectly affected by the heightened prospect of runs on the bank (at the same firm or elsewhere) and/or of the negative economic consequences from the associated harm to the liquidity function that banks and other financial firms serve in facilitating transactions that generate surplus.

# Antibiotics

The magnitude the tax based on European Union numbers ranges between 29 and 287€ per kilogram active substance or between 9 and 86% of the average price of commonly used antibiotics depending on the foreseen period in years (1–10 years) between the development of a new antibiotic drug.

# Smoking

One author found that including the costs of the long-term intellectual and physical consequences of smoking-related low-birth-weight disabilities implied a tax of $4.80 per pack (Hay, 1991)

The potential role of ETS costs in reevaluating the net negative externalities associated with smoking is seen by considering the following figures. Manning et al. (1991) noted that inclusion of the costs of 2,400 lung cancers from ETS (a fairly conservative estimate of this toll (Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) ) as external costs would add approximately 19 cents per pack in external costs (updated to 1994 dollars). In addition, inclusion of the costs of neonatal care for smoking-related low- birth-weight babies would add 3 cents to the total, while including fetal deaths attributable to smoking would add yet another 19 cents. Deaths from smoking-related fires would add a further 9 cents. The ETS costs would skyrocket if one included the estimated 30,000-60,000 heart disease deaths recently associated with ETS (Glantz and Parmley, 1995), adding perhaps 70 cents to the total social costs per pack. Similarly, inclusion of the smoking-induced respiratory tract infections and cases of aggravated asthma in children (Environmental Protection Agency, 1992) would boost the total further, as would inclusion of the long-term developmental disabilities in smoking-related low-birth-weight babies (Hay, 1991). All told, the social costs per pack could easily mount toward several dollars if all of the health hazards associated with ETS are real, many are treated as external to the basic consuming unit, and if all or even a significant fraction of the associated costs are included.

[@chaloupka2000economics]

Although nonsmokers subsidize smokers' medical care and group life insurance, smokers subsidize nonsmokers' pensions and nursing home payments. On balance, smokers probably pay their way at the current level of excise taxes on cigarettes

[@manning1989]

 Premature death means that covered costs will be incurred earlier and that the smoker will not be the source of such costs in subsequent years. If cutting off nonmortality-related costs in these later years offsets both the impact of accelerated health costs due to premature death and any tendency for expected medical costs to be higher from smoking-related deaths, then, with respect to expected medical costs, smoking will provide a net positive externality to the health insurance system.72 Smokers and non-smokers will have paid the same premiums, but the average expected costs paid out on behalf of the smokers will be lower. Nonsmokers will be subsidized by smokers. Of course, the externality may easily run in the other direction.

There is less ambiguity in the case of social insurance systems, such as Social Security in the United States. Within such systems, premature death from smoking typically results in a positive externality. Smokers and nonsmokers make the same contributions to the system, but these contributions will fund larger benefits for nonsmokers because they live longer.

Leaving aside ETS-related externalities, most researchers find that the negative externality related to tobacco use is small, justifying a tax on cigarettes on the order of fifteen to thirty cents per pack. This amount is less than the present federal tax per pack.

# Alcohol

The widely cited study by Leung and Phelps (1993) reviewed the results of studies estimating the price elasticity of alcohol demand. Although the studies show considerable variation, the broad pattern of results would be consistent with elasticities of -0.3 for beer, -1.0 for wine, and -1.5 for spirits.

Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998) find that the long-run elasticity in a model with addiction is some 50 per cent higher than the short-run elasticity

The most widely quoted US estimates of alcohol consumption externalities, appropriately defined, are those of Manning et al. (1989), who estimate that net external costs are equivalent in value to about 35 per cent of the producer price of alcohol. A very large proportion of the next external cost is accounted for by the valuation of alcohol-related traffic fatalities.

A very large proportion of the net external cost is accounted for by the valuation of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Since the number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities seems to vary quite widely across countries, this would suggest that these US estimates may not be a good indication of alcohol externalities in other countries. Parry (2001) notes that there are fewer serious alcohol-related traffic accidents in the UK than in the USA, and that the marginal external costs are consequently also likely to be lower in the UK.

Cost estimate is from [@harwood2000updating] by way of [@cnossen2007] updated to 2018 dollars using a [2003 exchange rate of 0.9 €/$](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/usd/USD-to-EUR-2003) and [inflation adjusted at 1.37 $2018/$2003](http://www.in2013dollars.com/2003-dollars-in-2018?amount=1)

In a pioneering study, Manning et al. (1989) estimated the net external costs in the mid-1980s at about US$0.48 per ounce of ethanol, double the average state and federal tax per ounce that was then in place. A similar result was reported by Pogue and Sgontz (1989). Much of the external costs were borne by victims of drunk drivers. The costs would have been higher still had non-fatal highway injuries (Miller and Blincoe 1994) and intra-family effects been taken into account. Furthermore, Kenkel (1996) estimated that the duty rate should be about equal to the pre-tax alcohol price, while Saffer and Chaloupka (1994) calculated the weighted average optimal US tax on alcohol at 2.3 times the 1991 level.

One of the most widely cited studies, by Leung and Phelps (1993), concludes that the price elasticities of alcohol demand are −0.3 for beer, −1.0 for wine and −1.5 for spirits. Clements et al. (1997) report price elasticities for seven countries (including three EU member states, i.e. Finland, Sweden and the UK), covering the period from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s. They find elasticities of −0.35 for beer, −0.68 for wine and −0.98 for spirits, which are broadly in line with those found for the US.

Intuitively, moderate drinkers should be more price responsive than heavy drinkers. Indeed, Manning et al. (1995) found that the median drinker had a price elasticity of −1.19, whereas light and heavy drinkers’ price elasticities were around −0.5. Specifically, the price elasticity of the heaviest drinkers (those in the 95th percentile) was found to be not significantly different from zero. At the 80th percentile, however drinkers were still significantly responsive to price, with a price elasticity of −0.74. In a recent study, Farrell et al. (2003) argue that higher duties would reduce alcohol dependence and abuse, estimating a high price elasticity of −1.487. This confirms the results of an earlier study by Kenkel (1993), who estimated the demand for heavy drinking to be at least as price elastic as the demand for moderate drinking.

As noted above, however, nearly all external costs are caused by 10% of the drinking
population who consume one-third to one-half of all alcohol sold.

# Carbon tax

One of the most prominent economists studying this topic is Yale’s Bill Nordhaus. Nordhaus [2007] has suggested a tax of $30 per ton of carbon, increasing to about $85 in 2050. A $30 carbon tax is fairly modest in size: it would increase the price of gasoline by only about 8 cents per gallon.

With these assumptions, Nordhaus concludes that a carbon tax starting at $7.40/ton of CO2 is optimal, so long as it increases by 2-3% a year in real terms (after inflation) until 2050, with steeper increases after that.

By contrast, the economist Nicholas Stern [2006] reached a very different conclusion in a study prominently released by the British government. Stern estimates the external cost of carbon emission at over $300 per ton — more than 10 times the Nordhaus number.

In his paper, A Green Employment Tax Swap: Using A Carbon Tax to Finance Payroll Tax Relief, published jointly by the Brookings Institution and the World Resources Institute, Metcalf recommends a carbon tax just under $17/ton of CO2.

Among these more rigorous analyses, the average or mean value of this measure was $50 per metric ton of carbon or $13.64 per metric ton of CO2." 

The mode is $220 per ton of carbon for a 0 percent PRTP, $93 per ton of carbon for a 1 percent PRTP, and $28 per ton of carbon for a 3 percent PRTP.

# Driving tax

One of them is carbon emissions, as I have been discussing. 

Another is local pollution, such as smog.

A third external cost is congestion. Every time I am stuck in traffic, I wish my fellow motorists would drive less, perhaps by living closer to where they work or by taking public transport. And they might well be thinking the same about me. In essence, each of us is imposing external costs on everyone else.

A fourth external cost is accidents and the higher insurance rates we all pay. That is, when I choose to drive, I make it more likely that I will be in an accident. That is, of course, an internal cost that I fully take into account when deciding whether to take my car out of the garage. But, in addition, when I drive, I make it more likely that you will be in an accident. That is an external cost, which from an economic standpoint is equivalent to pollution. The numbers here are staggering. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are more than 30 million traffic accidents a year. It estimates that the annual dollar cost of accidents, including property damage and personal injury, amounts to more than $400 billion a year.

There is a large literature that tries to put numbers on each of these external costs of driving. An article published in the Journal of Economic Literature in June 2007 summarized many studies and concluded that the optimal Pigovian tax on gasoline was $2.10 per gallon [Parry et al. 2007]. That is well above the current level of taxation in the United States, which is about 40 cents a gallon.

2.7.1 Noise. Unwanted automobile noise includes engine acceleration, tire/road contact, braking, etc. Noise costs have been quantified by estimating the effect of proximity to roads, and traffic volumes, on residential property values holding other variables constant (however it is difficult to control for natural and intended noise mitigation barriers, such as hills, sound-proof walls, double glazed windows). For example, Delucchi and Shi-Lang (1998) estimate costs between 0 and 0.4 cents per vehicle mile across different road classes, while US FHWA (1997), Table V22, put external costs at 0.06 cents per mile for passenger vehicles.

2.7.2 Highway Maintenance Costs. Analysts have estimated the effect of axle loads and traffic volumes on pavement damage for different vehicle classes, controlling for other factors (e.g., pavement age, climate). The key finding is that a vehicle causes road wear at a rate that is a sharply increasing function of the weight per axle, so that virtually all damage is attributed to heavy-duty trucks (e.g., Small et al. 1989, Newbery 1988). For example, US FHWA (1997), Table V-9, put external costs per mile at 0.06-0.08 cents per mile for passenger vehicles, and 1.59 and 2.78 cents per mile for the average single unit and combination truck respectively.

2.7.3 Urban sprawl. Many authors have argued that the low cost of motor vehicle use encourages urban sprawl (e.g., Brueckner 2000, Glaeser and Kahn 2003, Glaeser and Kohlhase 2003); in turn this may cause additional traffic congestion as well as lost natural habitat and aesthetic benefits from open space. However, there is little consensus on either the magnitude of increased external costs, or the relation between vehicle miles and development (e.g., McConnell and Walls 2005, Crane 1999). Moreover, if sprawl is excessive in specific regions this is primarily due to the failure of land-use policies, particularly development fees and zoning restrictions, to fully account for the external and infrastructure costs of new development.

2.7.4 Parking Subsidies. Many individuals park for free when they work or shop; Litman (2003) puts the costs from these parking subsidies at a substantial 3−10 cents per vehicle mile. Again though there remains dispute over whether free parking should be attributed as an external cost of automobile use as it results from other policy distortions, notably the exemption of the value of free parking from income and payroll taxes that apply to ordinary wage compensation.

2.7.5 Other environmental externalities. Improper disposal of vehicles and vehicle parts (e.g., tires, batteries, oil) can result in environmental and health hazards; however Lee (1993) put these costs at only 0.0015 cents per vehicle mile, and they have probably declined with more stringent regulations governing disposal and recycling. Damages from upstream emissions leakage from 15 the petroleum industry are also relatively small, around 2 cents per gallon according to NRC (2002).

## Distributional

A 1991 study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist James Poterba called ‘‘Is the Gasoline Tax Regressive?’’ concluded that ‘‘low-expenditure households devote a smaller share of their budget to gasoline than do their counterparts in the middle of the expenditure distribution.’’ The poor are far more likely than higher-income households to ride the bus or subway to work.

## Total

annual gasoline consumption per capita is around 470 gallons in the United States, with its low population density and limited transit availability, compared with only 90 gallons in western Europe

## Revenue

Numerous studies have estimated the own-price elasticity of gasoline demand for the United States and other countries. Most studies regress gasoline consumption on price, income, and other variables (e.g., vehicle ownership and characteristics), using time series data, sometimes with a lag structure imposed, or cross-section data. A decade or so ago, reviews pointed to a long run gasoline demand elasticity of around –0.7 to –1.0 (Dahl and Sterner 1991, Table 2, Goodwin 1992, Table 1, Espey 1996, Table 4). Later US studies that better control for fuel economy regulations, correlation among explanatory variables, or correlation among vehicle age, use and fuel economy, suggest a less elastic response. Another factor may be the declining share of fuel costs in total travel costs as wages, and hence the value of travel time, rise over time. US DOE (1996) proposed a value for the long run fuel price elasticity of –0.38, though other recent reviews by Goodwin et al. (2004) and Glaister and Graham (2002) put the elasticity at –0.7 and –0.6 respectively.
