# Alcohol

The widely cited study by Leung and Phelps (1993) reviewed the results of studies estimating the price elasticity of alcohol demand. Although the studies show considerable variation, the broad pattern of results would be consistent with elasticities of -0.3 for beer, -1.0 for wine, and -1.5 for spirits.

Grossman, Chaloupka, and Sirtalan (1998) find that the long-run elasticity in a model with addiction is some 50 per cent higher than the short-run elasticity

The most widely quoted US estimates of alcohol consumption externalities, appropriately defined, are those of Manning et al. (1989), who estimate that net external costs are equivalent in value to about 35 per cent of the producer price of alcohol. A very large proportion of the next external cost is accounted for by the valuation of alcohol-related traffic fatalities.

A very large proportion of the net external cost is accounted for by the valuation of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Since the number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities seems to vary quite widely across countries, this would suggest that these US estimates may not be a good indication of alcohol externalities in other countries. Parry (2001) notes that there are fewer serious alcohol-related traffic accidents in the UK than in the USA, and that the marginal external costs are consequently also likely to be lower in the UK.

# Fat

On 1 October 2011, the Danish Fat Tax Act came into effect.21 The tax of DKK 16 (around EUR 2.15) per kilogram of saturated fat is imposed on all food products produced in and imported into Denmark. The scope of the new legislation is established in Article 1 of the Act, which specifies that the following products are taxable: meat, certain dairy products, animal fats, edible oils and other fats, margarine, spreadable composite products, and other products which can be considered as substitutes or imitations of the above. The tax does not apply to products containing less than 2.3% per weight of saturated fat, which means that most types of milk are exempt.

# Carbon tax

One of the most prominent economists studying this topic is Yale’s Bill Nordhaus. Nordhaus [2007] has suggested a tax of $30 per ton of carbon, increasing to about $85 in 2050. A $30 carbon tax is fairly modest in size: it would increase the price of gasoline by only about 8 cents per gallon.

With these assumptions, Nordhaus concludes that a carbon tax starting at $7.40/ton of CO2 is optimal, so long as it increases by 2-3% a year in real terms (after inflation) until 2050, with steeper increases after that.

By contrast, the economist Nicholas Stern [2006] reached a very different conclusion in a study prominently released by the British government. Stern estimates the external cost of carbon emission at over $300 per ton — more than 10 times the Nordhaus number.

In his paper, A Green Employment Tax Swap: Using A Carbon Tax to Finance Payroll Tax Relief, published jointly by the Brookings Institution and the World Resources Institute, Metcalf recommends a carbon tax just under $17/ton of CO2.

Among these more rigorous analyses, the average or mean value of this measure was $50 per metric ton of carbon or $13.64 per metric ton of CO2." 

The mode is $220 per ton of carbon for a 0 percent PRTP, $93 per ton of carbon for a 1 percent PRTP, and $28 per ton of carbon for a 3 percent PRTP.

# Driving tax

One of them is carbon emissions, as I have been discussing. 

Another is local pollution, such as smog.

A third external cost is congestion. Every time I am stuck in traffic, I wish my fellow motorists would drive less, perhaps by living closer to where they work or by taking public transport. And they might well be thinking the same about me. In essence, each of us is imposing external costs on everyone else.

A fourth external cost is accidents and the higher insurance rates we all pay. That is, when I choose to drive, I make it more likely that I will be in an accident. That is, of course, an internal cost that I fully take into account when deciding whether to take my car out of the garage. But, in addition, when I drive, I make it more likely that you will be in an accident. That is an external cost, which from an economic standpoint is equivalent to pollution. The numbers here are staggering. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there are more than 30 million traffic accidents a year. It estimates that the annual dollar cost of accidents, including property damage and personal injury, amounts to more than $400 billion a year.

There is a large literature that tries to put numbers on each of these external costs of driving. An article published in the Journal of Economic Literature in June 2007 summarized many studies and concluded that the optimal Pigovian tax on gasoline was $2.10 per gallon [Parry et al. 2007]. That is well above the current level of taxation in the United States, which is about 40 cents a gallon.

2.7.1 Noise. Unwanted automobile noise includes engine acceleration, tire/road contact, braking, etc. Noise costs have been quantified by estimating the effect of proximity to roads, and traffic volumes, on residential property values holding other variables constant (however it is difficult to control for natural and intended noise mitigation barriers, such as hills, sound-proof walls, double glazed windows). For example, Delucchi and Shi-Lang (1998) estimate costs between 0 and 0.4 cents per vehicle mile across different road classes, while US FHWA (1997), Table V22, put external costs at 0.06 cents per mile for passenger vehicles.

2.7.2 Highway Maintenance Costs. Analysts have estimated the effect of axle loads and traffic volumes on pavement damage for different vehicle classes, controlling for other factors (e.g., pavement age, climate). The key finding is that a vehicle causes road wear at a rate that is a sharply increasing function of the weight per axle, so that virtually all damage is attributed to heavy-duty trucks (e.g., Small et al. 1989, Newbery 1988). For example, US FHWA (1997), Table V-9, put external costs per mile at 0.06-0.08 cents per mile for passenger vehicles, and 1.59 and 2.78 cents per mile for the average single unit and combination truck respectively.

2.7.3 Urban sprawl. Many authors have argued that the low cost of motor vehicle use encourages urban sprawl (e.g., Brueckner 2000, Glaeser and Kahn 2003, Glaeser and Kohlhase 2003); in turn this may cause additional traffic congestion as well as lost natural habitat and aesthetic benefits from open space. However, there is little consensus on either the magnitude of increased external costs, or the relation between vehicle miles and development (e.g., McConnell and Walls 2005, Crane 1999). Moreover, if sprawl is excessive in specific regions this is primarily due to the failure of land-use policies, particularly development fees and zoning restrictions, to fully account for the external and infrastructure costs of new development.

2.7.4 Parking Subsidies. Many individuals park for free when they work or shop; Litman (2003) puts the costs from these parking subsidies at a substantial 3−10 cents per vehicle mile. Again though there remains dispute over whether free parking should be attributed as an external cost of automobile use as it results from other policy distortions, notably the exemption of the value of free parking from income and payroll taxes that apply to ordinary wage compensation.

2.7.5 Other environmental externalities. Improper disposal of vehicles and vehicle parts (e.g., tires, batteries, oil) can result in environmental and health hazards; however Lee (1993) put these costs at only 0.0015 cents per vehicle mile, and they have probably declined with more stringent regulations governing disposal and recycling. Damages from upstream emissions leakage from 15 the petroleum industry are also relatively small, around 2 cents per gallon according to NRC (2002).

## Distributional

A 1991 study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist James Poterba called ‘‘Is the Gasoline Tax Regressive?’’ concluded that ‘‘low-expenditure households devote a smaller share of their budget to gasoline than do their counterparts in the middle of the expenditure distribution.’’ The poor are far more likely than higher-income households to ride the bus or subway to work.

## Total

annual gasoline consumption per capita is around 470 gallons in the United States, with its low population density and limited transit availability, compared with only 90 gallons in western Europe

## Revenue

Numerous studies have estimated the own-price elasticity of gasoline demand for the United States and other countries. Most studies regress gasoline consumption on price, income, and other variables (e.g., vehicle ownership and characteristics), using time series data, sometimes with a lag structure imposed, or cross-section data. A decade or so ago, reviews pointed to a long run gasoline demand elasticity of around –0.7 to –1.0 (Dahl and Sterner 1991, Table 2, Goodwin 1992, Table 1, Espey 1996, Table 4). Later US studies that better control for fuel economy regulations, correlation among explanatory variables, or correlation among vehicle age, use and fuel economy, suggest a less elastic response. Another factor may be the declining share of fuel costs in total travel costs as wages, and hence the value of travel time, rise over time. US DOE (1996) proposed a value for the long run fuel price elasticity of –0.38, though other recent reviews by Goodwin et al. (2004) and Glaister and Graham (2002) put the elasticity at –0.7 and –0.6 respectively.
