# Getting food

## Foraging

Anatomically modern humans showed up to the party rather late---perhaps as late as only [130,000 years ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/26/science/when-humans-became-human.html). This was right also right around the time <i>Homo sapiens</i> become [cognitively modern and capable of symbolic thought](https://theconversation.com/what-the-use-of-ochre-tells-us-about-the-capabilities-of-our-african-ancestry-47081). But looking good and thinking symbolically do not a good party make. Everyone would have been leaning against the wall and stealing furtive glances at each other for many millennia until they worked up the courage to finally invent language and talk to each other around 50,000 years ago.

So, regardless of what you use as your benchmark for modernity---anatomic, cognitive, or linguistic, the advent of food production in around 8,000 B.C.E. is relatively recent. That means, for most of human history, we've been foragers. "Foragers" are often called "hunter-gatherers" but this name is somewhat misleading. Hunting and gathering each typically contribute about 25-35% of caloric intake while fishing constituted the remaining 30-50%.

There is ongoing debate about just how sweet the pre-historic foraging life was. On one hand, per capita GDP between $90 and $200 for essentially forever doesn't sound so hot [@delong1998estimating] from the perspective of modernity. On the other hand, as we mentioned in [a previous post](/posts/anthropological-clickbait/), even modern foragers (who are typically thought to live in more marginal territory than early foragers) work fairly little. For example, the [!Kung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C7%83Kung_people) spend only about 42 hours on foraging, housework and tool-making all together. On the third hand, [John ["You've to break a few billion eggs to make an omelet"]{.noted}[^capacity] Zerzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zerzan) is on the primitivist side so no thank you.

## Food production

Like we said, the earliest food production arose in around 8,000 B.C.E. in the Near East. 

Food production perhaps arose because it was the only way to support increased population. At some point, new [bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society) of humans simply ran out of unoccupied territory to move into. Thereafter, population density would have increased beyond what foraging could support and horticulture, more productive per unit area than foraging, would have been the only option. This commonsensical theory of the rise of food production is called the Binford-Flannery model.

An alternative theory is that climate change reduced the availability of wild food supplies.

Regardless of the origin story, there are three major categories of food production:

Horticulture
:   "Plant cultivation carried out with relatively simple tools and methods". Probably the earliest form of food production. [Shifting cultivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_cultivation), in which land is worked temporarily and then abandoned while soil nutrients naturally replenish, is a common form. 60 of 186 <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> cultures are horticultural (variable 246) [@murdock1969standard].
Intensive agriculture
:   "Food production characterized by the permanent cultivation of fields and made possible by the use of the plow, draft animals or machines, fertilizers, irrigation, water-storage techniques, and other complex agricultural techniques." 57 of 186 <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> cultures are intensively agricultural (variable 246) [@murdock1969standard].
Pastoralism
:   "A form of subsistence technology in which food-getting is based directly or indirectly on the maintenance of domesticated animals." 16 of 186 cultures <abbr title="Standard Cross-Cultural Sample">SCSS</abbr> are pastoral (variable 246) [@murdock1969standard].

# Economic systems

## Allocation of resources

### Land

Land ownership patterns tend to covary with food-getting patterns. Typically:

Foraging
:   No individual ownership of land. Sometimes, territoriality by collective groups when sources of food are abundant and predictable.
Horticulture
:   No individual ownership of land. Sometimes plots are assigned for use.
Pastoralism
:   Grazing land held communally. Herds owned individually.
Intensive agriculture
:   Individual ownership of land.

## Conversion of resources

Alas, clothes, tools and other products don't grow on trees. Raw resources must be converted into final products. [@ember2014] categorizes these production processes as follows (I'll note that these categories seem a bit haphazard to me):

Domestic
:   "Labor consisted of people getting food and producing shelter and implements for themselves and their kin."
Industrial
:   "Because machines and materials are costly, only some individuals (capitalists), corporations, or governments can afford the expenses of production. Therefore, most people in industrial societies labor for others as wage earners."
Tributary
:   "[M]ost people still produce their own food but an elite or aristocracy controls a portion of production, including the products of specialized crafts."
Post-industrial
:   "Businesses are now more knowledge and service oriented. ... [W]hen information and knowledge become more important than capital equipment, more people can own and have access to the productive resources of society."

[^capacity]: Zerzan advocates a relinquishment of agriculture. [Earth can support maybe 10 million foragers](http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1451). The implications of returning to a global population of 10 million are obvious and terrible.
