Gross domestic product, or GDP, is often considered the best measure of
how well an economy is performing. In the United States, this statistic is com-
puted every three months by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a part of the U.S.
Department of Commerce, from a large number of primary data sources. These
primary sources include both (1) administrative data, which are byproducts of
government functions such as tax collection, education programs, defense, and
regulation, and (2) statistical data, which come from government surveys of, for
example, retail establishments, manufacturing firms, and farms. The purpose of
GDP is to summarize all these data with a single number representing the dollar
value of economic activity in a given period of time.
There are two ways to view this statistic. One way to view GDP is as the
total income of everyone in the economy; another way is as the total expenditure on the
economy’s output of goods and services.

Although most goods and
services are valued at their market prices when computing GDP, some are not
sold in the marketplace and therefore do not have market prices. If GDP is to
include the value of these goods and services, we must use an estimate of their
value. Such an estimate is called an imputed value

$$ Y = C + I + G + NX$$

GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net
exports. Each dollar of GDP falls into one of these categories. This equation is an
identity—an equation that must hold because of the way the variables are defined.
It is called the national income accounts identity.

To obtain gross national product
(GNP), we add to GDP receipts of factor income (wages, profit, and rent)
from the rest of the world and subtract payments of factor income to the rest
of the world:

$$ GNP = GDP + Factor Payments from Abroad - Factor Payments to Abroad$$

$$NNP = GNP - depreciation$$

$$National income = NNP - Statistical discrepancy$$

The six categories, and the percentage of
national income paid in each category in 2013, are the following:
Compensation of employees (61%). The wages and fringe benefits earned by
workers.
Proprietors’ income (9%). The income of noncorporate businesses, such as
small farms, mom-and-pop stores, and law partnerships.
Rental income (4%). The income that landlords receive, including the
imputed rent that homeowners “pay” to themselves, less expenses, such as
depreciation.
Corporate profits (15%). The income of corporations after payments to
their workers and creditors.
Net interest (3%). The interest domestic businesses pay minus the interest
they receive, plus interest earned from foreigners.
Taxes on production and imports (8%)

$$GDP Deflator = \frac{Nominal GDP}{Real GDP}$$

Fixed basket (Laspeyres index) -> CPI
Changing basket (Paasche index) -> GDP deflator

Problems with fixed basket:
- Substitution bias
- New goods
- Unmeasured changes in quality

Problems with changing basket:
- Substitution bias
- Unmeasured changes in quality

Factors of production

To sum up, the competitive, profit-maximizing firm follows a simple rule
about how much labor to hire and how much capital to rent. The firm demands
each factor of production until that factor’s marginal product falls to equal its real factor price.

Real rental price of capital $$MPK = R/P$$

Real wage $$MPL = W/P$$

the money supply.
In a system of commodity money, the money supply is simply the quantity of
that commodity. In an economy that uses fiat money, such as most economies
today, the government controls the supply of money: legal restrictions give the
government a monopoly on the printing of money. Just as the level of taxation
and the level of government purchases are policy instruments of the government,
so is the quantity of money. The government’s control over the money supply is
called monetary policy.
